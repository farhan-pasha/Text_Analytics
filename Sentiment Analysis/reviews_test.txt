Water For ElephantsBy Sara GruenSo for this book I decided to jump had first into it without reading any reviews or even the synopsis.  It turned out to be a very well written and beautiful story about love, hardships, and a circus. It's the great depression 1932, prohibition is in full swing, and like so many others a young man has had his entire life torn into pieces and ends up wandering straight into the adventure of a lifetime.  Jake Jankowski, the main character in our epic story, is distraught when he is informed that both his parents have died in an automobile accident. After, what we can only assume is a nervous breakdown while taking his final exams for veterinary school; he walks out and continues until he cannot bear to go any further.  While resting near a train track as a train rumbles up, and he decides to try to \hitch\ a ride to the next town not realizing he has jumped aboard a circus train.  From there he meets many characters who will forever change his life.I found myself falling in love right along with him, hating the villain with a fiery passion, and cheering for a quirky elephant named Rosie whom Sara Gruen describes so vividly that you can't help but smile.  Sara Gruen manages to create a scene so well you can imagine yourself there, but she never loses you with too many details.  Personally, I am torn whether or not I love this story.  In the first half of the book when she is setting a scene she would add some explicit details that weren't necessary. Since she had already masterfully created her setting and by adding those I can only assume she was after shock value.  I did enjoy the story, but I have a hard time swallowing adultery, I guess I have just been married too long.  I can understand why the characters were drawn to each other and why she would cheat on her husband, but I don't personally enjoy it.  In my opinion she could have used something else for her characters to over-come.  It's not like they didn't have three or four other obstacles to surmount. All and all I couldn't put it down so I suppose I can't be too harsh.,overall
Found story very interesting.  My dad traveled  with the circus five years when he was young, When I was young we went to every circus within 50 miles and I got to spend time in the back where most people do not see, Loved seeing and petting all the animals.  We stayed until cars were all loaded on thetrain. At that time the horses brought the cars to the tracks and then the elephants pushed them upon to the train. My Dad saw all but 2 of the states. I miss the real circus , The ones today are only so so.,overall
This book is a great read. Very enjoyable to learn about circus life. The author did a lot of research about the circus so it makes the story very real. I couldn't help but cringe sometimes with the story of the animals, but there is always a dark side to everything. Highly recommend it. An overall great book.,overall
Water for Elephants came highly recommended from several friends but it fell a little short of great.  The writing is good, but the love story is a little lacking.  In my opinion, Jacob and Marlena did not have enough scenes together for me to truly believe that they were falling in love.  I know the title is \Water for Elephants,\ but there was a little too much about the animals in this book and not enough about the people.  I know it was about the circus but I guess I'm the type who likes a better-developed love story if I'm going to \buy\ it.  I don't want it to sound like I disliked this book.  I didn't.  It just wasn't a story that blew me away.  It's a nice enough read for people who like sweet, well-written books.,overall
If you read a summary of the plot of this book, it's a little hard to swallow, and frankly, when my book club picked this one for June, I was a little less than excited.  Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised.OK, so I read this book on vacation, on the lovely island of Maui...any book might be great in those circumstances.  Still, I found myself thinking about it often when I wasn't reading.  Even though the plot is romantic at the bare-bones level, I never really felt like I was reading a romance.  Gruen does a wonderful job descibing the details of the circus, and I was more interested in the day-to-day details of train circuses than the romance.  I thought the interaction between characters and the historical element complimented each other well.If you read this book, be sure to read the interview with the author (at the end of the paperback edition).  Interestingly, Gruen admits that she had never been to a circus (never been to a circus???) before writing this book.  I see that as a testimony to the quality of her research and her writing.  I also love the way she integrates real stories that she has heard from circus folks with her fictional tale (all explained in the interview).Honestly, I thought the \prologue\ was kind of a sell out.  This story doesn't need the mystery the prologue tries to introduce.  If you skip it, you'll get just as much or more out of the book.Overall, definitely worth the read.  One of my favorites so far this year.,overall
A story based on facts about a depression era circus.  Story follows a vet and others he befriends in one of 100's of traveling circus's of the time.  A love relations develops, but the main theme is the cruelty and hard life the crew and performers must endure who are essentially endentured servants.,overall
Sometimes you just have to read a good story or, in this case, a very good story.  You don't need a lot of depth or socially redeeming value, just a real good story with a very good narrator/character.  This is that kind of book.The main character flees his final vetinary exams in a panic and joins the circus, rather accidentally.  There, in the midst of the Depression, he meets an assortment of interesting characters from roustabouts to sideshow attractions to performers to evil owners and animal trainers.  Of course, being the vet, there are also the circus animals.  He also falls in love.The characters are terrific, especially the narrator, who is introduced as a 93 year old gentleman reflecting on his past in the circus.  There are brief snippets of him in the nursing home that touching and humorous.  Beyond the characters that her narrator meets, Ms Gruen also captures the flavor of the traveling circuses hanging on by a thread during the Depression and the financial desperation of the times.  If one were to seek depth, this book observes the dichotomy between the roustabouts who will work without pay just to have a job and prospects of pay and the owners who eat and live well on the burdensome work or others.  But still, it's mostly a very good story.Although this book has been reviewed as a \romance\, there is much more here besides the romance and more depth to classify it denigradingly as a chic book.The book is well-written and the characters all very good, especially the main character/narrator.  He is an everyman and a keen observer of the world and people around him.  Highly recommended.,overall
Found this to be a very entertaining book to read.  Enjoyed the way the author took the main character from the present back into the past and back and forth.  Also a good education on circus life during the time of the depression.,overall
I bought this on the strength of the movie, and because I wanted to read something on my new iPad mini. It took me to a different time and place, and it was a good, quick read. If you enjoyed the movie, you'll appreciate the added detail that the book brings. The circus pix were a nice touch too.,overall
Water for Elephants is a terrific, light read about depression era circus life in the USA. Now of course, this type of circus is almost extinct due to the cruel treatment of both animals and those that they marketed as \freaks\, but there's no doubt that almost as much action and adventure happened outside of the ring as inside. The \Greatest show on earth\ was just as good a description of life on these itinerant circuses as it was to the events shown to they paying public. In the US, these great circus extravaganzas travelled by rail, and the collection of desperate workers, preening performers and animals ensured an interesting mix.Sara Gruen's tale begins with a wonderfully touching portrait of a 90-ish old man, Jacob, now left to live out his days in a nursing home. But in his youth, he was employed as a circus vet (although unqualified) and what a tale he recalls. Incidentally, the name Jacob is clearly intentional as there are a number of references on the life of the biblical Jacob from Genesis - although they are subtle and only add, rather than distract from the story.Gruen has clearly researched her subject in great depth (the addition of vintage photos from the era before each chapter that is devoted to the past is a nice touch) and there's a suggestion that at least some of the stories included either did happen or are rumoured to have happened. Just occasionally her explanations are a little clumsy, but they are needed to explain some of the terminology. But most importantly, she manages to get a sense of the faded grandeur and charged atmosphere of these great circus trains.At heart, this is a love story with a list of characters that include a grumpy dwarf, a drink-sodden old timer, a beautiful performer, a naiive vet, a mad director of animals, a toothless lion and a charismatic elephant. What's not to love?A movie is due out shortly, but although not having seen it of course, it's a fair bet there will be some Hollywood style sugar coating of this tale. The book includes both some steamy scenes as well as some gritty and potentially disturbing descriptions of animal conditions - and it's all the better for that dark side - so read the book at least before seeing the movie.,overall
This book was highly recommended to me, but it took a couple tries for me to get started.  Once the circus train has left the station, however, it is a very engaging narrative.,overall
This is a very interesting read because it describes, in great detail, a segment of life in the US that is not often known and was experienced by relatively few people. The story revolves around a traveling circus and the many characters who live with and work for the show. I will not go into any detail about the story other than to say that it is very well written, in a style that allows the reader to really see what is going on. Without giving away anything, the story is told from the perspective of the main character as he recounts the events that happened so many years ago. What happens to him at the very end is what generated the discussion. Was it a realistic ending or just a romanticized but unrealistic conclusion to the story? I urge you to read it and post your thoughts here.,overall
I enjoyed this book for the most part, particularly the characters and the tales of circus life. I would have given it 5 stars but thought the ending was weak. Also, the jumping from nursing home to circus and to nursing home was distracting.,overall
Sara Gruen has created an engaging memoir narrated by the nonagenarian veteran and veterinarian of a depression-era circus.  Her research into the caste hierarchy and politics of train circuses reveals a world which, much like HBO's Deadwood, had its own laws of lawlessness and morality of immorality.  Into this world Jacob Jankowski is unwittingly dropped, and the recounting of his evolution from inheritor of his father's veternary practice to circus vet to aged resident of an assisted living facility is almost always convincingly told.  While Jacob may be the hero/narrator, it is most definitely Rosie the elephant who steals the show and wins your heart.  Like the rubes who paid their nickels and dimes to gawk at the freaks, I felt my $14.37 was well spent for a 332-page peek behind the big-top.,overall
This book is a captivating potrayal of circus life during the depression years.  I believe that the author missed an opportunity; this book could have been longer and still held our attention if she had told more about the llife of the protagonist between youth and old age.  Perhaps there is a sequel that could be written.  The characters in the book are a fascinating mix and the author successfully describes the mix of good and bad characteristics that exist in all of us.,overall
I really like all the stories in this novel.  The characters are people I would like to have lunch with and get to know.,overall
Water For Elephants is a remarkable accomplishment, a wonderful book with colorful, unforgettable characters. It is by turns heartwarming, heartbreaking, exciting, and horrifying--with an ending that took me by surprise. I enjoy circus stories and have read several, none as good as this one (with the exception of Gus the Great). If you're old enough to remember the film The Greatest Show on Earth, this is it but without the slick DeMille romanticism. Water for Elephants is raw and realistic, one man's life in a circus and in a nursing home. There are other reviews here that give details of the plot so I won't repeat what they've said.There is a lot I loved about this book--the character of Jacob, the circus atmosphere,the story itself. It has many remarkable elements.One of the most remarkable is the nursing home part of the story. The author appears to be fairly young, several decades too young to know what it feels like to be elderly, to know you are failing physically, to be afraid you're failing mentally, to remember vividly when you were young and know you will never be young again. Yet she very convincingly shows you the heart and mind of a feisty old man. All in all, it's one of the best historical novels I have ever read. I wish I had written it.The above was the text of my original review and I stand by it. However, something vauguely bothered me about the book. Then, following a discussion I reread it and did a little research of my own. Now I know what it was. She is several years too early in her use of \paranoid schizophrenia\. By the time the old man is TELLING the story it would be in use, but certainly was not in use at the time she has a character using the term, and this seems like insufficient, possibly sloppy research. The other thing was the slaughter of several horses by cutting their throats. Horse people I know questioned it. A horse is big and powerful and would be frightened, not likely to let it happen unless he was heavily medicated. It seems done only for the effect of the gore. A properly placed gunshot would serve and be more merciful, more logical.However, I still think it's an outstanding book, even with the flaws, and I still wish I'd written it.,overall
If you've ever had to write a resume, you've come across the dilemma; which counts for more?  Experience or degrees?  The answer, of course, is experience, the real question being how one describes that crucial intangible.  Water for Elephants is the story of a man's youth, the experience he gains in a short period of time.  Essentially, it begins with him walking out on his final college exams and jumping a circus train almost accidentally.  This book is actually structured as a series of flashbacks, with the main character in roughly the present day, bracketing each chapter with comments about his current situation in a nursing home as contrast to his past adventures.  The main action takes place during the Great Depression, making for a fairly historical novel.Water for Elephants may feature a fairly original character with some serious common sense deficiencies, but Sara Gruen clearly did her research in terms of depictions of the period, inclusion of trade lingo, and depictions of animal behavior.  The adultery will probably keep it off high school reading lists, but I found it a pretty good window on what it depicted of the world outside of the circus.  This particular copy of the book also includes some commentary at the end regarding real circus history and anecdotes that were included in with the fiction.  Other than that, I know too little about life under the big top to comment on the depiction of events, other than to say that trains often did go slow enough to jump back then, even in the countryside, unlike now.I read this novel in less than a day, finding it to be a very compelling read, with a plot full of twists, even though the most climactic scene is also presented as the hook in the beginning preface chapter.  I would generally recommend it to everyone, even if you think you would have a problem with some aspects of it.  Try to give it a chance.  The main character is a vet, for example, and while animals are harmed in this circus, he doesn't like it any more than you.,overall
I enjoyed reading the book immensely. Learned a lot about the circus life through the book. I would recommend  to all!,overall
This is an interesting book.  It's well paced and the story keeps pulling you along, although I can't think of a single thing that makes it stand out.  It's not mysterious or adventurous and has very little romance in it, yet you keep reading.  Maybe it's just plain good story telling.,overall
Jacob Jankowski runs away from his ivy league veterinary education when his parents die in an accident and joins a circus on impulse. His training serves him well and provides him a place of esteem among the performers and the workers, an odd position which spans both groups. He falls for the lovely Marlena who performs with the horses, but she is married to August, a violent but charismatic animal trainer. The story culminates when the circus purchases an elephant named Rosie whose intelligence hides behind her thick skin.Some of the best scenes in this book are those in the nursing home when Jacob is an old man who can't remember if he is 90 or 93. The writing is sensitive, believable, and these moments are some of the most emotional snippets from the book. That is not to say that the rest is boring. Gruen has written a real page turner, and although it is not entirely original, it is incredibly entertaining.,overall
While I recommend this book, the slow up-start did little to urge me further. However, by the time the key players are in place, the plot picks up and makes for a fascinating love story with a gritty kick. My only real complaint is that the main character felt foreign to me throughout the book, but he seems to come into his own by the conclusion. This book will make an excellent movie.,overall
This book was an excellent way to spend my time. I learned so many things about the circus that I did not know before. Although, you do not need to be interested in the circus to enjoy the book. It does not bog you down in unwanted details. It gives you enough to paint the picture for the background of the story. It helps you to identify with the love story which unfolds before your eyes.,overall
This was a very interesting story within a story. A story reflecting back on the life of a man who is now in his 90's  in &#34;Assisted Living&#34;. We learn much about living a life in the Circus, especially back in the 30's....it was no picnic!! Along with tragedy we find adventure, humor and romance. I would have given the book 5 stars but for the swearing and sex content. I didn't expect that. It didn't have to be so explicit, so in my opinion the 4 star rates it a very good read!!,overall
This is one of those books that is so good you don't want to put it down. The book was way better than the movie. I would suggest anyone who enjoyed the movie to go back and read the book.,overall
It was a wonderful story. I can't wait to see the movie to compare. You really start feeling for the main characters,overall
Okay, I'm going to be brutally honest... I didn't want to read this novel because Robert Pattinson plays the lead male in the film adaptation. There I've said it. That horrible bit of judgement being said, Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen was a great novel that I would have been sorry to miss, had I not given it this chance.93 year old Jacob Jankowski is living in a nursing home when the circus comes to town. With the circus' arrival, Jacob begins telling a series of memories from his own life as a circus veterinarian.The story swiftly becomes a love story between Jacob and Marlena, who works with the horses and elephant. Marlena is married to the head trainer, August, who is abusive and brash. Jacob refuses to allow August to treat the animals or Marlena with such little respect!A sweet love story with great characters. I generally don't enjoy novels involving infidelity and since Marlena was married when she and Jacob fell in love, I was torn between being happy for them and being furious that she wouldn't leave her husband before allowing her love for Jacob to blossom. Everything happens the way it is supposed to and I found myself reading through this novel fast... I didn't know what the outcome would be. Definitely worth checking out!-Sarah[...],overall
This one took me a while to get used to, since the circus doesn't appeal to me naturally. I enjoyed the chapters narrated by the 90, or 93 year old, he made me laugh every 5 minutes. As the plot thickened during the cirucs era, my interest peeked and I can honestly say I enjoyed the rest of the book, and may be open to reading another book about the circus.,overall
I love animal stories, but I always read them bracing for the sad ending.  This book was a mixed bag.In the first part of the book, terrible things happened to both people and animals.In the latter part of the book, the angels practically came down to sing.  Everything good that could happen, did!  I'm not opposed to that.  It just seemed a bit much. Too simplisic.  Even the ultimate solution for old Jacob was just strangely perfect and therefore hard to believe.A logical question that bugged me about the plot was why did Uncle Al not get rid of the schizophrenic August?  And how in the world did August get to be in charge of the animals in the first place? He wasn't good with them.  Jacob or the other Polish worker would have been much more effective training Rosie.  If Uncle Al had ditched August, the inflammatory situation between him, Marlena, and Jacob would have been defused.When Jacob was scooping up Rosie and the liberty horses, I was silently pleading 'Don't forget BoBo.'  And he didn't.  Like I said, just too good to be true.,overall
Growing old is not fun, but this dear character had an exciting life, as you go back with him. Warm and emotional, funny and exciting. You really need to read this one.,overall
This book was a pleasure.  It is meaningful enough to warrant the time to read it and yet it is still fun and engrossing enough for a good poolside read while on vacation.  The protagonist's world is shredded near the beginning and he does what readers of this review would dream of but never do.  He hops a circus train and enters that most bizarre of American sub cultures of the depression era 1930's.  Read this and live vicariously in the circus from the comfort of your hotel's patio furniture.  You'll be glad you did and you'll feel more literate than if you read most of the trash you see at other chairs around the pool.,overall
I do not like the circus. Although it did seem like an interesting book,  I passed on it the first few times it came up on a search. Finally, I gave in.  I am so glad that I did.  This is an excellent book. I still will not go out of my way to get to a circus, but I do think of this book every time I see an elephant.  Thank you for a great read.,overall
This story was interesting in the fact that it was told as a memory of the main character.  Provided a look into life with a circus.  I have not seen the movie and not sure if I will.  Wouldn't want to movie to ruin the book by not following the story line.,overall
I really didn't ever plan on reading this- I saw it several times in walmart, and never really put a thought to it- but then I ended up getting it anyway one day when I went to my school library.It was actually very good, save for the fact that halfway through the book,  i felt like a part was missing.The book basically tells the story of young man, Jacob, who joins the circus after his parents die. Since he's college educated in vetranairy science (save for the fact he never took the final exams) he becomes the circus \animal doctor\. Soon he falls in love with the hot headed circus director's wife- and finds himself at odds with a uncontrollable- but loveable- elephant.The book is interesting, funny, and smart, but it definately wasn't perfect. First, it seems like a part was missing, practically. At the beginning of the book, the dwarf that Jacob rooms with, Walter, basically hates Jacob's guts. Plus, he meets the girl of his dreams, except that they don't really spend that much time together. Then, before I knew it, Walter and Jacob are best friends (and no reason to be) and Jacob and his girl (i forget her name, it's been a few weeks since I read it) are in love (but don't want to admit it because of her husband, August.)If you can get past these few things, the book is pretty good overall. Quite enjoyable.,overall
Learn a lot about the circus life.  Book holds your attention.  Interesting story being told through the eyes of a 90+ year old,overall
I didn't realize this was such a controversial book until I came to write my review. I liked the book. It is fast paced and an easy read. I did not like the explicit sexual scenes; I don't think they added anything, other than showing Jacob was nave, which we knew anyway. I didn&#8217;t like the animal abuse, and the fact that he was a vet and didn&#8217;t do anything about it, but if he would have he probably would have been red-lighted. The author did a lot of research about the circus in that era and it was interesting to read about some of the things that really did happen.,overall
The story held my interest since I had an uncle who was the front man for the circus.  The story line  took the reader through this man's early life and into old age with ease.  The characters come to life and before the book is finished one can smell the popcorn and the big top.,overall
I had a little trouble getting into this book, but I kept reading because my best friend loved it so much. After the first few chapters, I was hooked. I couldn't put it down, and I was sorry when it was over. Except for the slow beginning, it would've gotten 5 stars from me.,overall
I read this book as one of the monthly selections for my book group.  We all loved it.  It is a human love story, an animal love story, a novel about a young man who overcomes terrible loss and a tale of survival.  As a child of parents who grew up during the Depression, I was interested in how the history of that era played a role in the plot.  I found the descriptions of the social hierarchy of circus performers, their relationships with the animals and the perspective of how they function as a sub-culture especially informative.  The author makes us, the readers, really love or hate the characters, and there were a few times when I found myself wishing I could step into a scene and protect or stand up to some of the characters.  Although the ending didn't seem quite realistic, it does fit with the hopeful dreams we all conjure up when we visit the Big Top.,overall
This is a very good read. Circus life isn't a subject I know much about so from the historical perspective it was very interesting. I like that the story incorporates so many different sociological issues and is such a good argument for animal rights...especially circus animals.,overall
This is a good book. Its not the best I ever read but it was a nice easy read. I would read it again! Has a sweet story to it.,overall
This book was recommended to me and I'm glad I read it.  It is not something I normally would have read but I did enjoy it.  I knew nothing about the circus and so was fascinated by the story.  I usually read family saga type novels so found this one not as easy to read.  It is, however, an excellent book and well worth the time and effort.  Very interesting.,overall
An enjoyable three ring circus!  With many acts and clowns (both more ways than one.)  The reader participated... in sights and sounds!  This multi-layered book was a high flying wire show!  Bravo!,overall
Awesome story. Very captivating and well written. Thank you to editor of the book as well. Always nice to read a well written well edited book!,overall
This book had a bit of everything! At first I did not think I would be interested in reading about a circus, but that quickly changed!!!!,overall
I really enjoyed this book.  I usually like to read a book vs seeing the movie.  The book is usually way better.  This was a pretty good book. Loved the elephant. She was very smart in the end.,overall
I liked the information about traveling circuses. This book was an easy read. I especially enjoyed the time period and the first person accounts of life in a circus. The action in the story was unpredictable. I will be looking to read some of her other work.,overall
This is certainly an entertaining piece of work, one that will keep you occupied for the 4-6 hours that it takes you to read it.  Definitely not heavy lifting, but amusing and well worth the time.The story revolves around Jacob Jankowski, a 93 year old nursing home resident who \flashes back\ to his early adult years spent in the Benzini Brothers circus.  The circus backdrop provides the opportunity to introduce numerous colorful characters and anecdotes (many of which are historical) that keep the story moving along at a good pace.The book opens with a prologue which is revisited near the end of the novel with an extremely well devised plot twist and puzzler.  I thought this was extremely well done.  The end of the novel, involving the 93 year old Jacob, was also very satisfying.All in all, a light, entertaining and easily consumed piece of work.,overall
I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was a page turner and very unique.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick, good read.,overall
What an enjoyable story! At 65 I have memories of seeing small circuses as well as Ringling Bros.  I also find myself wondering about the future ... will I live to a ripe old age ... & will my family still care about me. This book was very well researched & written.,overall
This is a different story line than I'm used to reading but it was very interesting.  I read it in about a week.  I then gave it to my mom to read and she enjoyed it also.  Interesting take on circus life.,overall
I had no idea what circus life was like, & found this story to enlighten me. Cruelty to the animals is tough to read, but reality is sometimes difficult to face.  The interesting day to day life of circus employees, plus the dramatic differences in how workers vs performers were treated was dramatic! The relationships between the characters were interesting. I enjoyed this book in spite of the cruelty to animals & some vulgarity.,overall
I did enjoy this book. It was interesting to see how the circus used to be in the past. I thought it could have been better written and the plot seemed to fizzle out. But with a good imagination you can read more into the characters than the book discloses. Overall I am glad I read the book!,overall
It's a very imaginative story that you don't want to end. My only complaint would be that the bad language is a bit much.,overall
Jacob looks back to memories of love and his time with the circus when he was a young man.  He needs them now more than ever to get him through the declining life he lives out in a nursing home. The story portrayed a difficult, sad, evil circus environment where animals were mistreated by men who mistreated each other as well, I guess to survive the depression.  I wanted more from the story than its hopeful ending.  I wanted throughout to be lifted above its base struggles. I want more vivid descriptions of scenes and increased depth to the characters. What Jacob, like so many in nursing homes needed most was the comfort of family, friends, and staff to listen, to care. A well written book with depressing undertones.,overall
A wonderful depiction of life in the circus world as seen through the eyes of a man who worked in one during the great depression. This story comes to life more strongly with every turn of the page! Gripping!!,overall
I haven't seen the movie (I usually prefer the books anyway), so had little knowledge of the plot. I really enjoyed the history of how the country was during the Depression and how, basically, lawless the country still was, where people could come and go and even disappear. I enjoyed learning the levels of \society\ within the circus and the behind the scenes look at the life of performers and workers. Life was hard in those days with no government assistance to fall back on. Aside from the window into a different time and place, the plot was interesting too.,overall
I found this very entertaining. I enjoyed the story and found the whole (based on actual history) idea of Depression-era people running off to join the circus fascinating. The love story itself is a bit cliche, but this is a good read and better than many books I've read.,overall
This view inside the life of  people in a traveling circus is not like anything I have ever read before.  Since a friend told me it was her favorite book, I decide to step outside my mystery craving and try it.  While some of the situations are a stretch, the character development and especially the relationships were worth the read.  It tends toward darkness at times, so if that bothers you, this isn't the book for you.  If not, you might enjoy it.,overall
If you were a kid and experienced the train arriving, the parade of elephants, and the setting up of the big tent, this book will inform you of what went on behind the extravaganza!  I saw the performers outside with their buckets, but who would ever imagine what their lives were like?  I went to the side shows, ate the cotton candy and this book brought it all back!  This is a great novel with circus history that I fully enjoyed!  A perfect ending to those who wonder about Jacob's future!,overall
This is a fast, easily read, and entertaining book. A must read for animal lovers and circus lovers alike. Kudos.,overall
Author Sara Gruen has given a wonderful, sad, and hopeful picture of circus life and of the life of a young man who joins the circus at twenty-three.  Jacob Jankowski begins the story of his life when he is a very old man living in a nursing home where he is less than happy.  The story goes back to his young life when he is a veterinary student and suddenly loses his parents in an auto crash.  After the funeral, Jacob plans on going back to school and returns, only to be unable to take his exams, writing nothing and walking away from his years of education to join the Benzini Brothers circus. Because of his veterinary knowledge, Jacob is assigned the care of the animals and their problems.August, the animal trainer, is married to Marlena the elephant-rider and beautiful star of the circus.  Jacob's mistake is falling in love with her, because August is a brutal man, both with his animals and with people.  Often an elephant named Rosie gets the brunt of his anger, and so does Marlena, and eventually Jacob.  The rubes suffer under just about everyone in this circus, which has a long way to go to even give Ringling Brothers a thought about it.What I enjoyed most about this book is the very colorful and accurate information that Gruen researched well and delivers about the circus.  The acts in the ring, the different people who make up the circus and the pecking order among them makes for an excellent story.  I found the ending fairly predictable, but I was glad I was right.  Water for Elephants may make you angry, it may make you nostalgic, but it will certainly entertain you and keep you reading until the last page.,overall
This is my second review on Amazon.  I seriously have a lot of catching up to do.I love books about animals as I am such an animal lover myself.  The read was cool, which hotted up at the end, although a little slow moving to begin with.  In the second half I couldn't put it down, I had to know the ending as I was on tender hooks all through the time.  I guess part of this story was very emotional.  Well worth a read despite the slow beginning.,overall
Not the most amazing book as far as plot/meaning/intellectual mind blowing goes. However, \Water for Elephants\ is an extremely entertaining tale-- a fast paced fun ride of a read. I couldn't put it down and had it finished after three days.,overall
Was curious about this book and decided to purchase the Kindle version of it and check it out.  Throughout the course of the  book you see Jake in the nursing home and Jake in the past.  Jake in the nursing home is looking forward to seeing the circus which has come to town.  But first he has to deal with a couple more days until that time comes and you learn a little bit of what his like is like in the nursing home.  He's not too happy and he every once in awhile starts to reminisce what it was like when he was much younger and he became part of a circus.  Since he had been in veterinary school before stowing away on the circus train he ends up being put in charge of the animals.  One of which is an elephant.  The elephant is not treated well at all and Jake even becomes frustrated with it until the day he realizes that the elephant doesn't understand commands because he learned them in another language.  Once that barrier is broken he and the elephant end up developing a close relationship as he's about the only one who actually treats the animals with any compassion and care.  He also falls in love with Marlena who is married to the very temperamental ring master.  Considering the time period of the book, it's quite possible that her husband suffered from manic depression as the man's mood swings go from very happy to incredibly abusive and destructive.  Over the course of the book we find out more of what happened between Jake and his elephant and also what happened with him and Marlena.Throughout the course of the book you learn a lot about what circuses were like back in the thirties.  Sometimes a bigger circus would acquire a smaller circus and combine the two.  A lot of times the workers went a long ways toward being paid.  And sometimes the owners of the circus would scramble from opportunity to opportunity in order to have enough money to keep the circus running.  And the performers traveled from city to city by train, which would have not only been hard on them but as the animals as well.  If you like animals this can be a difficult book to read from time to time, but it's a fascinating look at circuses that I enjoyed the book very much anyway.  Someday I may get the sequel to find out more of what happened to Jake both past and present.,overall
A good friend of mine who is a Veterinarian, recommended this book to me several years ago. Based on her review, I purchased the book and it sat on my bookshelf for three years!! I considered reading it several times, but it was always passed over in favor of other novels that sounded more intriguing. Once I started seeing trailers for the movie adaptation of the novel with Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson, I finally extracted the book from its place in the bookshelf and read it. THANK GOODNESS I did! Water for Elephants is a brilliantly written account of a Veterinarian student who loses his parents in a car crash and ends up joining a circus in a chance encounter. The author clearly depicts what circus life was like in the 1930s and builds larger than life circus folk whose personalities bounce off of the novel's pages. I highly recommend Water for Elephants, it's a story of loss, love, animals, circus shenanigans, and betrayal. It's a fun romp with a great ending that you'll thoroughly enjoy.,overall
I enjoyed reading this book mostly because I am facinated by circuses.  I also would continue to read it because I was interested to learn what would happen to the lovers in the book.  I recommend.,overall
This book is the saga of Jacob Jankowski and the unplanned course his life takes as a result of the untimely death of his parents. One exam away from graduating from Cornell with a degree in veterinary medicine and a partnership with his dad, his world is thrown into a tailspin after losing both parents at the same time to an auto accident. Jacob is devastated beyond belief and just starts to run away from everything, finding himself following a train, unbeknownst to him, a circus train. The author takes us on an incredible journey within the travels of the Benzini Circus during the years of the Great Depression. Let's not forget Rosie, the amazing elephant that endears herself to Jacob and becomes the star of the show.  Read on to learn the special secret that makes Rosie a star and the bond that develops between Jacob, Rosie and Marlena (the wife of the head ringleader and a very troubled man). This is a story you won't want to miss - the movie was good but the book is the very best.,overall
An enjoyable read, with colorful characters that tug at your heart, but I deducted a star because the ending seemed somewhat unnatural and didn't quite fit in with the pace of the novel. Overall, this was still a good story, highly recommend it.,overall
This book did an amazing job of transporting me to another time and place. Reading it, I really got a wonderful sense of the times during 1931 as well as the brutal daily way of life for people working for a traveling circus. I loved how well the characters were developed.I would have given this book a five star rating however the main love story felt a little too obvious and tired. The underlying love story is how the main character falls in love with the circus and, more importantly, an elephant.,overall
I enjoyed this book and was eager to finish.  A good light read and unique story.  I enjoyed having the past and present features.  Now I want to see the movie.,overall
Good story line and intersting characters.  Not a \change your life\ type of book, but a good read overall.  I have recommended it to several friends and they have enjoyed it as well.,overall
This book held my attention from the start with wonderful characters and an engrossing story.  Grim at times, but probably true for the time.,overall
Water for ElephantsBy Sara GruenIn the experience of this reviewer romantic books of any kind are generally written for those with a sentimental heart, and a genre that I try to avoid. Who doesn't like a good love story now and again, but the modern romantic drama or comedy seems to be written for a specific audience. Without trying to be presumptuous or overly sexist modern romances are a genre mainly written by women for women. So when Water for Elephants was suggested and then selected to be read by the Super Cool Facebook Readers Club I assumed it was a book that was written for the opposite sex and one I would find hard to enjoy. But as it is warned so often not to make assumptions and hardly ever heeded, I found that my assumptions about Water for Elephants were incorrect. Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen, a bestselling author and book is a romantic drama that can be enjoyed by all readers.Water for Elephants is a story about an aged man, Jacob Jankowski who we discover in a nursing home and through his memories we are taken on a dark and romantic journey to his youth as a veterinarian in a traveling circus. Jacobs past comes rushing to the front of his mind when a circus arrives and sets up next to the nursing home he resides in. In Water for Elephants the reader gets to experience a forbidden love between Jacob and one of the star performers of the Benzini Brothers circus, Marlena. The whirl wind romance between Jacob and Marlena is both suicidal and heart melting. The reader also gets a good dose of violence and sexual content as the traveling circus life during the depression era of the 1930's is unfolded for us in dramatic fashion by Sara Gruen in Water for Elephants. Add in an elephant who understands only the Polish language, a masturbating midget and his dog Queenie and an untold number of corrupt acts and you will discover why Water for Elephants is a romantic story that can be enjoyed by just about any one.Although the idea of a nursing home has been used by other authors as the stage for telling a tale about ones past it does not hinder the story. Sara's creative writing abilities and her knowledge about all things circus keep the nursing home in the background of the readers mind until the very end. And if there is anything that could be considered a hindrance to the book it might be the end itself. The end of the story, where  Jacob, 90 years young rides off into the sunset with the traveling circus that was set up next to his nursing home, creates more questions than can be answered by the novel.All things considered Water for Elephants is a well written novel by Sara Gruen. The work of literature has the ability to capture the attention of both men and women. Water for Elephants is a unique romantic drama that will capture your attention with heart melting romance, intense episodes of violence, graphically detailed sexual acts and a traveling circus. Water for Elephants is an unforgettable and exciting novel that will have you talking about it long after you have read it.(written on 7/10/2011 by the administrator of the Super Cool Facebook Readers Club, based loosely on the  discussions held by the club about the novel Water for Elephants.),overall
Love reading historical fiction that has been researched. Amazing. I would recommend to my adult friends that love to read the same,overall
Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is a gripping story filled with both the sadness and the joy of life. Hope and regret thread through the pages gripping the reader in a heartrending but mesmerizing journey. Filled with characters struggling to choose right over wrong as well as those who are selfish and greedy, the reader will alternately lament their choices, feel their pain, sympathize with their struggles, and cheer their successes. Animal lovers beware there are some fairly graphic depictions of the way circus animals have been treated over the years. Gruen's unapologetic descriptions of circus life for all involved, the workers, the performers, and the animals strips away the romanticized idea that running away with the circus could ever be the answers to one's troubles in life. All the while, Water for Elephants also grounds us in the reality of aging and reminds us that perhaps we should listen a little and \do\ a little less. Gruen's writing immerses the reader in a world so real the reader feels compelled to remind one's self it's fiction.,overall
Water For Elephants follows Jacob Jankowski who is either 90 or 93, he can't remember, as he reminisces about his days during the most trying time in his life.  He was about to graduate from Cornell with his degree in veterinary medicine when he gets word that both of his parents have died.  Not only that, but he finds out that because of the economy (during the great depression) his father's veterinary business was so far under that their house is taken and the business is gone.  He has nothing left but to take his final exam and somehow start a new life completely on his own.  In the middle of his exam he breaks down, runs away and hops a train out of town...  but it's not just any train, it ends up being a circus train for the Benzini Bros circus and they don't like stowaways.  This begins a roller coaster ride that will last 3 1/2 months with a crash course in taking care of large animals, understanding business, befriending a grouchy midget and learning what love truly is.Passion, hatred, murder and even a wild animal stampede add to the delight I found in this book. We see glimpses of the 93 yr old Jacob living in a nursing home feeling helpless followed by wonderful tales of his life on the circus train with Rosie, Walter and the lovely Marlena.  I found it to be extremely well written and it flowed nicely always making you want to read on and see what will happen.  Sara Gruen did a great job of switching back and forth between young and old Jacob and keeping the story just as interesting while in either time.  I was just as attached to and invested in 93 yr old Jacob as I was in the young handsome veterinarian with morals and principles from Benzini Bros Circus of 1931.I definitely recommend this book and will probably read it again once I make it through my summer TBR list.,overall
Great story with colorful characters.  The author obviously did her research.  It was great to see some of the pictures I remember from a childhood visit to Sarasota.,overall
a very enjoyable story. the characters were colorful and the writing really captured the circus carnival atmosphere behind the scenes.,overall
There is not much more I can add to the numerous reviews this book has already received except to say that I loved the book and thought that it was for the most part an original story and was very pleased with how the story progressed and ended.As original as the story was, I did find that there were some predictable plot points, but these didn't detract from the story in any way.  Also, I believe that I read another review in which the reviewer indicated that this was more of a book for kids and pre-teens.  While I don't agree with that, I do think that written a slightly different way (taking out the minor sexual content) that yes, this could have been a very good book for kids.  Nothing wrong with that. I'll give this one a 4 1/2 star rating.,overall
This novel is really interesting in that it explores the world of circus performers in the post depression era of the U.S.  The details are amazing and it is obvious the author took great care to create an authentic feel for the time period and life of circus performers.  A passionate love story is revealed that will capture your heart.  The reflections of an old man in the story tie it all together with wonderful sensitivity and charm.  I thought the title was really creative. I became immersed in the circus world with ease while enjoying this engaging novel.,overall
I had never heard of this book until I saw the trailer for the movie.  My wife is the true reader of the family and wanted to read the book before seeing the movie in theaters.  I downloaded it for her and found myself sitting around bored and started reading it myself.  I was instantly hooked.  The reason I wasn't interested in it was because I thought it was a romance book.  And, I guess, in a way it is.  But for me it was more about a romance with the circus.  Who doesn't love the circus?  Especially, the old train circuses.  I spent the first several chapters totally oblivious to my surroundings as I read about Jacob and how this whole journey started for him.  I loved the chapters devoted to him as an elderly man and how the author enveloped me into his frailty almost to the point that I felt like I was jerked away when the story switched back to his time at the circus.  The characters are so colorful and the descriptive writing helped fuel my imagination of this world.  My only minor complaint is that the story felt rushed towards the end.  Everything wrapped up in a few quick chapters.  Maybe it was just me not wanting to leave just yet, but it just seemed too quick.  I highly recommend this book and encourage other people, men I'm looking at you, to not be put off by the cover with the stars of the movie on it and think it is a mushy romance novel.,overall
Although I wasn't sure I'd really care to read a book about the circus, I was pleasantly surprised to get a bit of circus \history.\  Although it is a first novel by this author, the writing is captivating.  It goes back and forth in time, from the viewpoint of an elderly man (in an assisted living facility), and tells a story of his life on the road with the circus in post-Depression years.  Quite nice ending to the book also.,overall
After recently completing a 750 page, current best seller, hardcover sleeping pill, I needed something that wasn't going to tax me too much. This fit the bill perfectly! I escaped to the circus!I had my doubts in the beginning when we are introduced to Jacob, a 90 something (he's not sure anymore) \character\ in an assisted living facility. I braced myself for anxiety but that was unnecessary. What I was introduced to was a feisty gentleman telling his story about a journey of a fascinating period in a young man's life. I never gave a single thought about train circuses of the past, but have found an interest in them now.Jacob's journey starts with how he unwittingly wound up with the traveling circus. It covers his duties of caring for the animals, his friendships and his untouchable heart throb. Jacob may not be the most controversial character you will ever read about and does lack some spunk and fortitude, but he's a good guy in the story and you'll be rooting for him from start to end.Some of the animal situations are disturbing but realize it was reality of the time. I am thankful there has been a good deal of enlightenment since then. The animals, incidentally are a huge part of the story and I found them every bit as interesting, if not more so, than the human characters.This was a well researched, well written look at a bizarre lifestyle. My biggest complaint is I kept wishing there was some type of lexicon or glossary because I did not have a good understanding of some the jargon, and the terms weren't described well enough. With some effort, I guess I was able to put it together enough to have a vague understanding of the situation but it was a distraction for me. Other than that, the book kept me entertained through the final page. Escape to the circus, and enjoy!,overall
I read this for book club, and I think it was a great choice for that environment.  The book itself was a very entertaining read, and I was really able to connect with the main character.  I thought that mixing the stories of the elderly and young Jacob was a very clever way to enhance his character.  There were parts where I laughed out loud, and parts where I teared up.  And just when I was losing hope for a happy ending, the little plot twist wrapped the book up perfectly.The reason that I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because there was nothing in this book that blew me away, whether it be the plot or the writing style.  In addition, I felt like Marlena was a bit too one dimensional.  I was never really able to feel connected to her as a character or the love story between the two of them.  That said, it is definitely worth reading, and was a great choice for book club.  Everyone liked the book and it naturally lends itself to discussion without needing to have an overly structured approach.,overall
First off, the imagery in this book is amazing. The pictures painted by words are so vivid that I felt like I was watching the action on screen.The story is set in the 1930s and follows Jacob Jankowski, a vetrinary school dropout, and the few months he spends working for a circus (Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show On Earth). Jacob is exposed to the harsh lifestyle of a travelling circus. He meets Marlena, who is a performer, and falls in love. The only problem is that she is already married to August, the equestrian director (who hired Jacob in the first place).The central element of the book however, is the circus itself. The reader gets a look into the inner workings of show, the characters that work for it and this is done in a very dextrous way. Gruen makes the reader understand the technicalities of circus terminology and life without spelling out definitions. Her insight into the characters (with a few exceptions) is also very interesting. I found the beginning part of the book fascinating as the 90 or 93 year old Jankowski reflects on how things change with age.The criticism I have is that certain charcters are somewhat faceless. I found this to be true of Marlena. This makes her relationship with Jacob seem contrived and their interactions cliched. The dialogue between them towards the end is predictable. Also, the character of August, I felt, could have been better developed.Overall, this is a fine book and I had fun reading it.,overall
I won't give away too much information, but my take on this after reading it was that we are exposed to some wonderful characters, an interesting, albeit a bit slow plotline, a romance and a themes prevalent to me are that true love will survive, animals have feelings too, never say never, life is cyclical (circular) and we are never to old to do anything.A beautiful story, brought me to tears once or twice.,overall
Water for Elephants was probably one of the most action-filled novels that I have read. Every chapter was vital. The circus (or carnival) life was a new area for me. It was grimy, brutal and had some of society's misfits... yet there was humanity,loyalty and tenderness,too, thank goodness. I felt it was a well-researched and crafted story.,overall
Started off very slow hard to get into the book. Kept persevering and it got better and when I finished found i could have kept reading it.,overall
I kept seeing my grandmother in this story, not in the experiences, but the frustration with her body failing to last as long as her mind. She has all the spunk and none of the ability. She questioned the care and cost, as she was struggling to survive a health scare recently. The wisdom that comes with old age is now often disregarded due to the loss of physical ability,,overall
This was one of the most memorable novels I have read in the last few years.The narrator, Jacob, is \ninety or ninety-three\ and lives in a nursing home. The arrival of the circus next store leads him to reflect on his experiences working on a circus during the depression. I have never been to the circus but Gruen makes the days when the circus was still a big event come to life.Several things make this story stand out. First, instead of the usual format where the elderly person only appears to introduce a flashback, in Water For Elephants, the story alternates between Jacob's present life in the nursing home and his life as a young man in the circus. In the audio version, there are separate narrators for the younger Jacob and the older Jacob. This makes it easy to tell where you are and adds to the realism.At first I found myself wanting to get out of the nursing home and back to the circus, but by the end I cared as much about what was going to happen to the elderly Jacob and I did about learning the secret of his past. Even so, I thought the writing about the circus was especially powerful. Gruen's ability to evoke the world of the depression-era circus reminded me of Ann Rice's ability to make me feel that I am in New Orleans. She puts you in the menagerie with the animals, and Rosie, the elephant, is a character you won't soon forget.Finally, there is a surprise at the end, which leaves you feeling happier than you expected.This is a relatively short book that I think anyone who loves animals will enjoy.,overall
The only complaint I have about this wonderful book is that it ended too quickly. It was full of intensely interesting characters who had real depth and texture. I felt that I was part of the story, and it was a real pleasure to read this great book. Amazing ending. I loved every page.,overall
This was not Harry Potter or Twilight by any means, but still a great read!  I couldn't wait to pick it back up the next night and start reading again.,overall
I found this to be quite entertaining.  I was a huge fan of the sections where Jacob is an old man.  It had a fantastic ending which is where so many books fall short.,overall
A very endearing story told by an old man reflecting back on his time as a circus vet.  Enjoyed the insight into circus life during the Great Depression, with all its madness, tragedy, and colorful characters. High spirited with lots of drama and emotion. Predictable ending , but nonetheless satisfying.  Could easily see this one making it to the big screen using the same cast of characters from the Titanic.,overall
I enjoyed reading the book and I really liked how it all wrapped up in the end.  The only thing I didn't like was the flipping back and forth from past to present.  I didn't really see any need.  And, I wished that there wasn't a prolouge (seemed to give something away ...too soon).  Although, the characters were great and the book was fun.,overall
I really enjoy Sara Gruen's ability to tell a story, and she captures circus life in a compelling way. I felt the characters were very tragic and it was difficult for me to read about so much animal abuse, eventhough I understand August was a very sick character.,overall
This book is pretty enjoyable to read. It is not the most exciting book I have read, but it is not a bad read,overall
Generally, a very good but somber look at circus life in the '30s. Like a circus train starting down the tracks, the book got off to a slow start but, like the train, picked up traction and speed as it went on.  This is not a happy book about a circus.  It's a naturalistic look at the big top and all that goes on under and around it.  Mostly, it aint pretty.  The plot was well-executed and most of the characters well-developed.  The author threw in a lot of fascinating detail about circus life and that of the Depression years in which most of the action takes place.  Her insights into the mindset of a 93-year-old man were apparently right on the mark.  There's a love affair here, which could have been better done.  There's an elephant here, who is the star of the book.  There are bad guys and rubes -- and one or two good guys.  I would say the book is more interesting than entertaining, but entertaining it was.  If you are a fan of circuses -- and who isn't? -- you'll get a lot of satisfaction out of this book.,overall
This is a nice, easy-going, and well paced book. It is never dull and keeps  the reader interested. However, the story-line is, some-what, predictable.,overall
I had not read Sara Gruen's work when my book club decided to read Water for Elephants...now I am a big fan! The writing is clear and engaging, the story is filled with vivid characters (including Rosie the elephant), and the action is well paced. Gruen seamlessly interweaves the story of an aging ex-circus vet and his recollections of the exciting (and often dangerous) road show days. With her interesting research into the carny heyday, Gruen transports the reader into another world, including the fascinating vocabulary of the performers and roughnecks. A lovely story!,overall
If I could rate higher it would be 10 stars. The author did her research. The characters in this book seem so real. You will laugh, you will cry, you will feel hatred. You will cheer. You will be moved.,overall
I really cannot understand the bad reviews. This book is really good, the research amazing and the descriptions put you right THERE in the hobo camps, among the tracks, the dirt, poor workers and the wide broad differences between the performers and the grunts.I loved this book and the old mans' musings.. the ending was so awesome..I would give this 10 stars if i could..,overall
Every once in a while you find a book that just ticks all the boxes. I enjoyed every page of Water for Elephants and was sad when I finished. A lovely story for young, old and everyone in between.,overall
This book was absolutely wonderful. Two chapters in, I knew it was going to be one of my favorite books I have ever read.. and it is. I could not put this book down! I definitely recommend it.,overall
This book was a wonderful read throughout- I have loaned it to many friends since and everyone has enjoyed it. I would highly recommend this book to all types of readers as this story appeals to many.,overall
This story is one of the most entertaining I have ever read! The author makes her characters come alive to the point where you feel they are family (the good ones anyway). I love the style of writing she uses, there is never a boring minute in this story about circus life. I would advise anyone who enjoys a story with animals and some very likable characters to get this book immediately! This is one entry that will never be deleted from my Kindle!!,overall
I cannot begin to explain how much I have fallen in love with this novel.  I've never been so entertained, intrigued, horrified and ultimately satisfied by a book.  Each character had so much to offer to the story.  I slowed down as I neared the end knowing I had to say good-bye to Jacob, Marlena and Rosie (the smiling elephant!).  I will definitely go to the nearest bookstore and give Gruen's earlier novels a try.  This is by far the best book I have read in a long time.  I am recommending it to everyone I know!!,overall
I don't typically buy books like this. I loved it. The story is unique and easy to become invested in. The characters are lovable from the very start. PLUS it's just a very coherent read which is a huge bonus for me. I really can't imagine who wouldn't like it.,overall
Fast moving and gripping novel.  Historical details about circus life and live in general during the Great Depression are fascinating. You can't miss with this book.,overall
The reviews were right, this was exceptional!!! What a truly eye-opening reveal of the way train circus life was for all those involved. I felt so many emotions all through the book and was certainly sad to have it end. A great 'read'!!!,overall
I wasn't sure about this book after some of the reviews, etc. I guess the whole circus thing wasn't of interest to me, and so I put off buying this title for months. But last week, I gave in when it was listed at a phenomenal price. And I have to say, I loved it!It is by far the best thing I have read on my Kindle. Exciting, romantic, adventurous and slightly sorrowful at times. The characters were unforgettable. I adore Jacob at age 21 (and age 93) and he is a wonderful protagonist. This book is about circus life and the tragedy of a young man, but it is a love story as well. It is also filled with creatures great and small. So would I recommend this? Yes... because Water For Elephants is fabulous.,overall
If you haven't read this book, you should definitely pick it up! It's definitely on the top 10 of my list! It is a must read for everyone. I loved how Jacob found an opportunity in the mist of his grieving over his parents' death.  He completely turned his life around for the better.  This book was not only a love story for me, but it was a book of adventure.  It had me sitting on the edge of my seat a few times during my read.  I like how the book takes you back to Jacob's past & present.  The ending of the book was completely unexpected for me.  I did not see it coming, but it's where Jacob belongs.  I think you will have just as much fun reading this as I did.  I couldn't put the book down!!,overall
Jacob's life takes a drastic turn when his parents die. Stripped of everything he owns, everything familiar to him, all the comforts of his college and family life that he took for granted, he leaves his old life behind, jumps a train that turns out to be a circus train, and enters a totally new, different world. A circus is fun, right? Not behind the scenes, in this book. Jacob, a young adult, naive, still a virgin, unused to such a hard life on the road, confronts danger, murder, hatred, love, callous human viciousness, more danger, and finds friends and allies (not all of them human) in the unlikeliest of places.The story is told in turn, by the nonogenarian Jacob now in a nursing home, and at other times, by the twenty-something Jacob working at the circus and trying not to get killed -- mostly at the hands of his fellow-human-associates. Every chapter is an adventure, held my attention and took turns gladdening, saddening and surprising me.The circus animals also get into the act in this book and the author's sensitive rendering and treatment of them makes them all the more vivid, as \supporting actors\,  Circus \employees\, and fellow participants in the intrigue and action.A masterful ending -- leaving the reader with hope, glee and wonder. The very informative afterword by the author left me wanting to do my own research into this fascinating subject of the Circus.,overall
What can I say? I'm not sure why I waited so long to finally read this book. From the prologue, this book held my attention. Gruen's writing style and attention to detail is simply amazing! At several points, I felt as though I was actually watching the show or walking beside Jacob while working in the menagerie. It felt real. And the perverse, morbid sense of humor she gives Jacob as an elderly gentleman is laugh-out-loud hilarious! Although, I must admit, I found myself fuming over the treatment of our senior citizens. That, however, is a rant for another time!The characters in this book are so rich and deep. It was hard not to form some sort of fondness for them. In addition, I found it amazing that Gruen was able to turn Rosie into a full character without completely humanizing her. Even though I have a strong bond to animals, I still felt a close connection to Rosie.From a lot of her terminology, knowledge of trains, animals, freaks, etc., I really think that Gruen did a lot of research before writing this book. It makes it a lot more authoritative and realistic. While the story itself is fiction, it makes it that much more believable and credible to be interspersed with fact.I will say that the happy ending, Jacob's extreme sensitivity, etc. might be seen as extremely campy. However, I felt that Gruen was trying to find something positive during the Depression. I feel that she did try to capture that, even though there was food a shelter, life on a train circus was not good either. The Depression was hard on everyone, and no one was left unaffected. So, while there was romanticizing occurring in the novel, it felt as though she was trying to make a fairytale in an unlikely setting. To me, that makes it even more endearing and tender. Many reviews I have read complain that she is trying to push an agenda with some of the issues she tackles, but, to me, this was just a romantic love story of two people finding each other against all odds. I do, however, have to laugh a little at the ending. That part might have been a bit over the top,overall
Much has already been said about this book, so I'll throw my five stars into the mix and keep it brief by saying this is an absolutely delightful story. I would definitely place it toward the top of my list of fictional tales I have thoroughly enjoyed.,overall
This is really a fun read. The story is interesting, the writing flows easily, the characters are real and believable, and even though I thought a story about a circus during the depression era might be depressing, it was extremely interesting. I really enjoyed it and have placed it amongst my 'keepers.',overall
As always, the book was better than the movie. The movie was far too simple. The characters are actually very well developed in the book, with much better dialogue (that wasnt ruined by actors). Yes, I guess it's a romance novel, but not in a Nicholas Sparks kind of way. I think it's enjoyable for all audiences.,overall
When I picked up Water for Elephants, I wasn't quite sure of the topic and was afraid I might have to put this book down - low and behold, it was a great book - very entertaining, the pages just kept turning and I finished the book wanting more!  The story of circus life is like none other, as is this book....,overall
Just finished this book and I thought it was really good.  I thought the circus subject was interesting, along with some romance and I was really pleased.  For the last 25% of the book I was really gripping my kindle, waiting to see what was going to happen next!  This book did not disappoint!,overall
Wow, where to begin. I literally just finished the novel, and was left with the most beautiful feeling of what it means to capture the essence of humanity. Yes! This is something you don't experience too often, and when you do you want to hold onto the feeling and never let go. I'm not going to give a plot summary, or play by play- that's what the product description and other reviews are for. This is a reaction review. I never really wanted to read this novel when it was all the rage. I would walk past it as I scanned the bookshelves, and ignore it on the best-seller list. However, when I saw the 3,000 reviews and all the positive stars mounting up, I knew people must be onto something. That coupled with my Kindle Fire Christmas present, and this is free in the Kindle Lender's Library.Where to start? From the moment you start reading, you are sucked right into Jacob's world, and the world of the circus. You find yourself running alongside Jacob, and taking part of the daily activities of the circus. The characters are highly developed, and you hate, love, and grow with each one of them. The author takes time to even develop the animals which I feel helps readers bond to the very world they now find themselves in. The story is never short of action, passion, compassion, suspense, and so much more-often at the same time. I found myself holding my breath for long durations of the novel anxiously awaiting what happens next.train In short, this novel is simply beautiful.,overall
I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Water for Elephants been the only book all year where every one of my friends from book club gave a book such a glowing review.,overall
I'm going to be careful here, because I don't want to spoil anything for potential readers.  Let me just say it is a great book, sometimes disturbing, but often funny and charming, or filled with action.  It also has a good bit of grit and tenacity in the main character.  It is a look inside a unique community that you wouldn't get a chance to view this close if you weren't being \escorted\ by  one of their own.  You may be tempted to stop reading at some point if you are an excessively tender soul, however hang in there.  All you need to know for now is this, it is a fresh well-written book that you will love and ends in a good way so, have no fear of it and enjoy.,overall
I am very interested in the time period of this story and setting. I am refreshed by their hard times, their often cruel lives and how they could even make it from day to day. There was one moment early in the book, I almost laid it down and didn't pick it up for it was so oppressive to me. I am an avid animal lover so I felt a double punch to the gut. Yes, I cried. Overall, it was a journey, through hard times...but you know what? They made it, and will continue.,overall
This book provides an upbeat feeling and introduction to a lifestyle all its own during economic struggle. World.... welcome to the world of the traveling circus of times of yore. An easy read, very entertaining.,overall
Enjoyed the way the story took place in different times. Loveable characters. Characters that were believable and true to life.,overall
Had not yet watched the movie, but absolutely loved the book. A touching story, sometimes sad,  yet happy ending.Really conveyed the time period. I would highly recommend.,overall
Since I've never written a review on Amazon, you can bet it would take one heck of a book to get me to do it. Water for Elephants is that book. I buy a LOT of books, and with most of them I'm left feeling dissatisfied. But with this book I read it over a weekend and just tore through it. Solid writing, thorough research, believable characters, and a great story. I just love this book! As a fan of HBO's Carnivale, it reminded me a lot of that series, but make no mistake, this is NOT a derivative work. I'm just hoping that Gruen will return to this universe in the near future and give us another installment.,overall
I have not seen the movie and was not sure how I'd like a book about the circus but a lot of people recommended this novel and it got great reviews so I gave it a try. It was beautifully written with vivid imagery. How could you not fall in love with Jacob? How could you not be enterained with the stories about the circus? How could you not be enthralled with Marlena and Jacob's secret love? I really enjoyed reading it, in fact I could not put it down and it only took me a week to read it. I think this is a story anyone could enjoy, and the author did an amazing job with her research about everything from the circus to the prohibition. The parts about the old man got kind of depressing but there was a happy ending for all at the end. Highly recommended. Lovely read.,overall
A beautifully written, richly descriptive love story, and a wonderful testimony to the intelligence of animals. I haven't seen the movie, and I'm afraid I'll be disappointed.,overall
One of the best books I have ever had the pleasure of reading!  I was so surprised at how well and clear it was written!  I loved every page.,overall
I got WATER FOR ELEPHANTS as a gift from my husband. When I opened it I said to myself, why on earth did he buy me this? I aked him what prompted him to chose it - he said because I've had a life long fascination with Freak Shows and they're part of the Circus. OK. Fair enough.If it hadn't been for him buying it for me I would have missed out on what has become my favorite piece of fiction I have ever read.I am in love with this book.This book is enchanting. The characters are, variously, loveable, hateworthy, pathetic, nasty and dastardly.Sara Gruen knows her characters so well and writes them with such passion they seem real. You will feel that you know them too. And the writing is so vivid you will feel like you're standing ring-side. Inhale deeply - can you smell the cotton candy?And the ending of this book is the most perfect, satisfying ending I have ever, ever read.I'm not going to pigeon-hole it with category or genre and risk putting some people off...like me.There are some Book Club talking points at the end of the paperback version and one such talking point is to discuss the book's 'pathetic glamour.' That is a perfect descriptor. The circus fakes its glamour and its glitz; the daily lives of the crews who work it are anything but, and at times are brutal, harrowing, even.I've learned a valuable lesson from this book - what I want as a reader is just writing that takes my breath away. I got that from WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.,overall
I normally do not review books so that I don't spoil the read,l but I must say that this is a beautiful, touching, and emotional novel. Great!,overall
What a story and what insight into the life of the hero.  From young man to old, he kept me turning pages.  It also caused me to assess my attitude of older citizens and my interaction with them.  And who doesn't love a circus.,overall
A truly wonderful book! A good read for everyone. I highly recommend for all ages. You will not be disappointed!,overall
I liked this book because it took me out of my normal modern day romance pieces to a place with such charm and drama and entertainment I just thoroughly enjoyed It.,overall
I haven't seen the movie, but did see previews.  I though it looked like it could be good, but was raised where the book is always better than the movie.  I still haven't seen the movie, but I must say that this book is GREAT!  I debated buying it for weeks, and I am NOT disappointed at all that I did.  I honestly wish I would have bought it sooner!,overall
So enjoyed the book, well researched, enticing story, pulls you in with romance and suspense. Excellent storyline, you fall in love with the characters and dont want to let go.,overall
I have read many books lately and this is by far one of the top ten books that I have read!I never wanted to put it down. Exceptionally written and thoroughly developed! Not a disappointment throughout the entire 464 pages.This is a book that everyone should read!,overall
I finished all 350 pages in a day and a half. I Couldn't put it down. I've read a lot of great books, but this is by far my favorite of all time and it sooo deserves the five stars I gave it. It's like heartbreak, friendship, falling in love, fear, being forgotten, and a blast from a cruel yet exciting past all in one and I may go read it again once I finish this review. Water for Elephants broke my heart and touched me at the same time.,overall
I loved the movie, but the book is so much better.The ending is so perfect! I wish it was longer!,overall
Water for Elephants has a quality so many modern novels are lacking, and that is an sense of enchantment. So many novels these days take you to a place you would really rather not be, but even the scruffy world of the down-and-out traveling circus is full of mystery and--dare I say it--soul. Love doesn't hurt, either. My 84-year-old mother dislikes modern novels (too much bad language) but she loved this one.,overall
It took a bit to get used to the flashback style of this book, but I very much enjoyed this story and all the characters.,overall
i loved it. im sad i waited so long to read it though and its the best book ive read this year,overall
I am speechless.  This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  I literally could not put it down and was so sad when it ended.  This book brought out every emotion in me.  Loved it!!!,overall
Skip the prologue and just start the story. Reading it won't hurt, but I felt a little tricked. And it was such a good story on its own. Love the old photos of the circus. Gruen did a great job with her research, I felt like I was there in a way that doesn't happen often.,overall
This was a great book. It reads fast, and there are a lot of things going on simultaneously in this book which need to be thought about. I really enjoyed every word, and am going to check out her previous book next.,overall
Wasn't sure I was excited about reading a book about the circus, but this was a great story with an easy storyline to follow.  My book club enjoyed it!,overall
In addition to writing an engaging story that offers a glimpse into a fascinating world foreign to most of us, Ms. Gruen shows herself to be a master \architect\ with this novel, crafting a story that flows seamlessly between two radically different eras in her protagonist's life. The book starts with a flashback, so you know at some point it's going to bring us back to the opening scene. But Ms. Gruen does so in such a surprising and unexpected way, with a twist that left my jaw on the floor. It's not an exaggeration to say I was stunned.With Riding Lessons and Flying Changes, Ms. Gruen proved she was capable of writing good commercial fiction.With Water For Elephants, she proves herself capable of writing a great American novel.,overall
This is one of my all-time favorites.  The story is engrossing.  Rosie the elephant is an amusing and wonderful character. Loved her.,overall
I just finished reading this book and I loved it! I put off reading this book for about a year because I thought it was about a circus and I'm not a fan of circuses because of the history of maltreatment of the animals within circuses. I thought it was about a circus but I was wrong, it was about much more than that. It was a wonderful read and I recommend to everyone.,overall
Odd. Heartbreaking. Funny. Insightful. Thrilling. Shocking. Everything.Learn about circuses, nursing homes.What really got to me was when (how is incredible) the author got into the head and heart of a 90 year old man and bared his soul to us.Gotta go, I'm going to cry,overall
This book is a quick read and a must for any summer reading list.  I read it while in a book group but devoured it and then went looking for more wishing that the story would go on.  A lovely story of a young man's life with the traveling circus amid the depression.  Having never read anything on the life of a circus traveler it was eye opening and riveting.,overall
What an amazing book.  The story is engrossing, the main character is lovable and realistic and the story is fascinating.  This is one of the best books I have ever read.Bravo!  Amazing book. It made me smile and it made me cry.  I simply LOVED this book and will recommend it to all my friends.  Well written and wonderful characters.  Great read.,overall
I've had this book for two years and only just read it last week.  Why did I wait so long???  This truely is a gem.  You feel like you know all the characters, and the ones you don't know so well are introduced with enough hints and inuendos that you can easily imagine their colorful pasts.  I fell in love with the elephant.  She brought a wonderfully odd twist to the story.And as for the author, I was half way through the book before I paid attention to the jacket picture and realised that it was a female. She wrote exactly as a man would tell the story.  The elderly Jacob was perfectly portrayed.  She has obviously been around very old people and knows how they act and react to all kinds of situations.I truely did not want the story to end.,overall
and take a look at &#34;behind the scene&#34; of a &#34;train&#34; circus from a long ago era.  The book appears to be impeccably researched and the author has drawn on some stories that contribute to the books entertainment value and poignancy.Earlier reviewers have already provided a look into the plot so no need to reiterate.  I devoured the book in about three days and place it in the top 10 books read within the last year.  I found the characters, both human and animal, brought vividly to life and in a way that really made me care about them.  The ending might be a bit of a stretch for some but somehow so very appropriate.  Water for Elephants is definitely worth the time to read, imho.,overall
Fabulous story. I read it before the movie. The book was way better. I loved that Gruen did significant research to make the story realistic. I appreciated all of her notes at the back of the book.Dream Weaver (Dream Weaver Novels) (Volume 1),overall
Great story line.  Who doesn't love the circus?  It was a great tale interweaving compelling and interesting characters, and flashing back from the experiences of a 90 (or 93) year old man and his younger self and his experiences with the circus of old.  Wonderful ending, but I won't spoil it!,overall
I decided to read this book because of the movie coming out in April. Well, what a wonderful discovery! This book sucked me in from the first page. I could not put it down. I highly recommend reading this book if you are considering seeing the movie in April.,overall
I didn't realize this was going to be a movie when I bought the book.  I'm almost dissapointed that the movie is coming out - they never live up to the books.  Narrator is an old man, and so funny. So much details in a circus I had no idea, and putting it in the 30's adds so much more to the story!  Enjoy.,overall
I didn't see the movie. I wasn't interested in the story, but I somehow ended up with a copy and read it. I loved it! It was a wonderful surprise.,overall
I kept passing this book up because I just didn't think I would like it. Was I wrong. Loved it!!,overall
I loved this book. Definitely a good love story based on trust and understanding of ones past. Have yet to watch the movie, and don't think I ever will.,overall
Loved this book!,overall
The author painted a vivid picture of each character and moment of the book. The way the author portrayed the biggest moment of the book in at the very beginning became a shock at the end. Excellent read -- hard to put the book down.,overall
This was a very enjoyable book; while reading I thought \this would make a great movie\; I didn't realize until a week later that the movie comes out in April 2011. I usually download \free\ books; I am so glad I paid for this one, it was worth it.,overall
Twists and turns.  The book is based on actual historical facts blended with a great fictional story line.  It is full of believable characters.,overall
Water for Elephants is a love story set in a post depression traveling circus and told from the memory of 93 year-old man.  The story jumps between the current life of the narrator a uncontented man who believes he is 90 or 93 and his rememberance of the love story between Jacob and the Benzini Brother's circus.After the death of both his parents Jacob a veterinairian student finds himself penniless. Although not intentionally  he runs away to the circus where he finds love.This story give great historical flavor and is a must read.,overall
What a great storyline from beginning to end.  With such an amazing assortment of characters that feel like someone you know.  A great read.,overall
I am not by any means a reader or fan of \Mainstream\ novels. My tastes tend to lean decidedly toward the stranger side of fiction (Little, PKD, Laymon, etc). But I decided, while strolling the aisle of my local Amazon store, after reading review after review that all but bowed before this title, to try it. I am so glad I did.I tore through this book, not wanting to leave Jacob stranded too long. I just \couldn't put it down\, I know how terribly cliche' that is, but it is the absolute truth.This novel made me smile, which normally is a turn off for me... what a nice change of pace. Pick this book up if you haven't already. Sit down with Jacob and listen to his story, you'll smile too.,overall
A friend recommended this book and I was thoroughly engulfed in it from the beginning. Such raw, real life and survival during the depression era. Jacob is a wonderful main character who is thrust into a world, grieving and desolate after his parents sudden death leaves him with nothing. The story is told by him as an old man of 90 or 93 as he says and is truly blunt on how our elders are treated in nursing homes and devalued as human beings. But, the wonderful, painful and thrilling story of his life, his love and his journey after his parents death lands him in a circus is spellbinding.Just know that the ending will make you smile and cry and feel joy for Jacob!,overall
Amazing characters. I'm still in shock over the fate of even the most disgusting characters in the book. Truly a masterpiece.,overall
Great book. Was hard to put down after you start reading. Wonderfully written. Seemed like you were actually there and you could see and hear the story as it unfolded,overall
I bought this book orginally when it first came out. It has been sitting on my shelf untill this weekend. I started this book early morning and had it done by the end of the day. I couldn't put it down!I the author does a great job with switching back and forth between times. Alot of authors try and do this but can't acomplish it but this one did a great job.The book held me in suspense the entire time. There never was a down moment in the whole book. Something was alway going on to keep the readers attention. I loved that he did research to write this book. The pictures also helped with what you were imagining as you read it.The author does a good job with making us have a love hate relationship with many of the characters. One minute I wouldn't think someone was that bad and then the next thing they did I couldn't stand them or vice versa.The interaction with the animals brought in a whole different set of characters. Rosie seemed almost human to me.I hated and loved to finish this book. I haven't found something this good in a while.,overall
I found this to be a wonderful book, full of memorable characters.  It was hard to put down.  The story shifts between the main character as an old man and his memories of  life with the  circus,overall
I had heard a lot of positive comments on this book for a while and thought I would see for myself what all the praise was about.  Well this book deserves 5 stars and more.  It is really a book that will stay with you for a while.  I know it will be among my all time favorites, as well it should.  The writer has done an excellent job fleshing out the people and you almost feel as if you know them personally or have dealt with people like time in real life.  The depression was deep in the US when the story is introduced.  Life can hand out a lot of hard knocks, even to animals.  I really never thought about that aspect of life before. I am very happy I had the opportunity to read this book.  I delayed reading it many times because frankly the title put me off.  Then I remembered to never judge a book by it's title.,overall
I had no idea this book was about the circus. I really enjoyed it. You know you've read a good book when you are sad that it's over.,overall
I have a tendency of sticking with supernatural stories because I love the magic of them. While \Water for Elephants\ is far from supernatural, this story was easily the definition of magical.The story actually starts out in the nursing home, which is so intricately described that I could hear the whirring of the mechanical machines; helping the patients stay alive, and I could smell the putrid scent of finality in the air. Instantly I was pulled in by the lyrical writing style. The author also does a nice job of analyzing life's major questions, and hopping on her train of thought was enjoyable.The unwinding of Jacob's memories is done so beautifully. Gruen achieved what few authors can and brought her characters to life. I almost felt like I was hearing this beautiful, heartbreaking, brave and wonderful story first hand, staring at Jacob's frail body beneath the fluorescent lights of the nursing home.This book took me on a journey, and at the end I wasn't quite ready to hop off the train. There was a twist I never saw coming, and my only regret is it took me so long to pick this one up and read it. I recommend it for people who love a story of adventure, bravery, and love that overcomes all obstacles.,overall
I have read this book twice now, and every time it feels like I am discovering it all over again. Great writing and story telling.  It evokes all sorts of emotions at appropriate times, and in the end I felt completely satisfied.,overall
I loved the story and how the author merged the memories ofthe old man with his younger days.  I couldn't put it down!,overall
I loved this book.  And to think it was the first from Sara Gruen at that. This is a book that spawned the movie of the same name.  I saw the movie first, then read the book, then saw the movie again. As often happens, the book provides much more color than the movie ever could. For instance, the owner of the circus, Big Al, is shown in the movie in only one scene for a moment giving approval for a purchase.  Sara researched the subject of &#34;train circuses&#34; in detail.  The cruel practices common during the depression to stay in business are shocking, but make riveting reading as the backdrop for this story of growing up, awakening, and goal-seeking.  Highly recommended.,overall
I loved this book. I had seen the movie a while back and loved it. A friend of mine recommended the book and said it was much better than the movie. She was right. Gruen does a great job of developing the characters and you feel connected and part of the story.  I'm glad I finally read it.,overall
I really enjoyed this book. Sarah Gruen did a great job of telling the story ofcircus with all the beauty, cruelty and the harsh life during the depression.The author states that she did research the circus during that time period and it shows in her writing.  She really describes the  people and animals that were the main part of a circus and they  come to life in my mind. I could see and hear them as I read the book.It starts off with the main character, Jacob Jankowski as a very angry oldman in a nursing home. He decides to go to the circus and reminisces about his past. We are then introduced to the young Jacob Jankowski. The book goes back and forth in time as many do today.The author really nails it when she writes about the depression. I have read and studied the depression and she portrayes it so vividly. I felt so sorry for the workers, performers and the animals. They all suffered in one way or another.The characters had their flaws.The book paints the Ringleader as a charming but violent man. One who had a short fuse and was a loose cannon.I was fascinated by Jacob Jankowski. In spite of the hardships that he had to endure,his kindness and gentleness never wavered.I admired Marlena as a beautiful, graceful and long-suffering woman. She was  not brave enough to leave. I recommend this book to all. The movie followed the book very closely except the Ringleader was not as mean as in the book.,overall
The character of Jacob going back and forth between past and present.  I fell in love with Rosie the elephant.  It was a hard to put down novel.  Highly doubt the movie can match the visuals created by the story itself!,overall
This book grabs you from the minute you pick it up. It has intrigue, dysfunction, love, and amazing human-like emotions in the circus animals (from Rosie the elephant to Queenie the terrier).The movie was great, but the book had so much more depth and character-development.It seems so incredible that anything like this could happen in \real life\, even during this period in US history. Tough circus life is described inamazing detail.The lopsided human love triangle adds another dimension to this book and its dysfunction. Would highly recommend this semi-fictional novel.,overall
This book was everything I hoped it would be and more. A heart wrenching love tale set in the circus world in the great depression era. The characters capture your heart and hold it captive until the very last page.,overall
This book was recommended to me by a friend.  I bought it for my Kindle, but it sat there for months as I wasn't in my \literary\ phase.  I finally decided to give it a go, and was so incredibly surprised!  I LOVED this story!  It was filled with so many emotions and the characters are depicted in such a vivid fashion, I could picture them so clearly!  They stayed with me for quite some time after completing the book and that rates VERY high with me.  I even got my husband to read it and he loved it as well.  I really couldn't put it down until I knew just what happened to everyone....and the ending?  AMAZING!!!!  I cried in joy, fulfillment, closure and sadness!  Wonderful read!-Just My Opinion [...],overall
This is a book to escape into where you cheer for the good guy and hate the bad guy! A glimpse into another life.,overall
This story takes place during the Great Depression.  It is a love story, but also a story about life with a traveling circus and all the rawness and crudeness that goes along with being part of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth as remembered by Jacob Jankowski.  Normally, I'd much rather do my own reading, however David LeDoux and John Randolph Jones did an excellent job; the ninety-something-year-old Jacob was especially enjoyable.  When he read, I felt as if I were sitting next to him in the nursing home listening to his amazing story.,overall
This was an excellent book! I always love the books more but the movie was just as good! Very well researched and written...definitely one of the top books!,overall
Thought of my Dad more than once while reading this.  Highly recommend this read on a summer evening.  Thank you,overall
Very thought-provoking and well-written. And the story told from two different time frames was very effective. It was also good to include interview(s) with the author telling about how she researched the story, too.,overall
Water for Elephants was a great book! Loved the transition from young Jacob to old Jacob, the parallels between the circus and the circus that was the nursing home. I could have done without some of the language but all in all the book had me hooked from the beginning. I recommend this book for anyone interested and unsure. It will not disappoint.,overall
How a book about a 90 year old man can be so interesting and entertaining I don't know but this book is both.  I will recommend this book to anyone.  The story is an old man in a nursing home recalling his life in the circus.... a GREAT read.  The story has heart, action, suspense, tenderness...a real page turner.,overall
Wow!  I picked this up to read on the airplane to & from Las Vegas.  I wound up finishing it while on my trip.Gruen is a wonderful story teller, you can tell she researched extensively for this novel.  While it's not a book really about a circus, that is the main setting for most of the book.  I really thought it would be a book all about Carnie Folk.  How far from the truth was I?!The story is told from the view of an ageing circus vet, which is different to begin with.  One would think that these types of stories would be told from performer's points of view & while that would be interesting, Jacob's POV is just as intriguing as another other's would have been.It's a great short read that's captivating & spellbinding.,overall
I can't say I have ever read a book that was even remotely similar in plot or storyline. Water for Elephants is one of the most original novels that has ever graced my eyes. I felt all the emotions Jacob did as I read, and the story seemed to transition seamlessly between the present, and his memories without being confusing as some other books can be when they try the memory flashback thing. It's one of the few books that I read that I simply could not put down, stopping only to eat and sleep.,overall
This is a very beautiful, well-written story that at times had you really feeling - both good and bad feelings - for many of the characters. Jacob lived a hard life after his parents died but I appreciated his tenacity. He was determined to make it in the circus and to make it in life. I throughly enjoyed the ending and I think if I was Jacob that that's how I'd want to spend the rest of my days too. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to read a story about real life, struggles, love, loss, and hope.,overall
...so all I can do is add my voice to chorus.Gruen writes an incredible dual-novel.  The tale of one man, both fresh out of college and fresh into a nursing home.  The character development is impeccable, with every player on the stage being exposed to the reader to the precise level needed for their role.  As for the plot...this is such a fresh story, I had no idea where it might be going.  This was the first book in a long time I hadn't figured out ahead of time.If you enjoy fiction, read this book.  Possibly the best written novel I've read in years.,overall
Very interesting history of circus life.  Could not put this book down.  Wonderful story filled with flashbacks of circus people and environment.,overall
This unique story brings back a slice of the 1930s, the long gone circus world of the past, but not the usual bigtop action.  The main character is without giving away anything serves in a position that straddles the worlds of performer and worker and yet belongs to neither. There's madness, grinding poverty, tradgedy, revengeexcitement, bewilderment, surprises, and revelations, but I don't believe a review should be a book report, so trust me if you like suspense, tinged with the meaning of life itself, please do yourself the favor of reading this wonderful novel.  I wish I could erase my memories and do so afresh.  Jim.,overall
This novel made me want to meet someone who had worked on a circus before.  The prologue is all I read in the store and I immediately felt the need to buy it because of the mystery.  The book is filled with exciting storylines that will capture your attention and keep it there throughout the story--hoping that the storyline will end as you hoped.When you get to the part in the book that the prologue mentions, the actual outcome will surprise you. The animals all find a way into your heart and the characters are all worth remembering and holding on to.  I recomend this book for anyone interested in historical fiction or even science fiction because while it revolves around reality, a cirus, the way that it is written almost feels like science fiction.,overall
I don't read fiction.  A snob journalist, I believe my time is better spent reading non-fiction. Due to reasons I won't bore you with, I picked this book up and thumbed through the first couple of pages, just to see if the writing was any good. I didn't put it down. Read it through to the finish. (The last time this happened with me and fiction was fifteen years ago with \Boy's Life\ by Robert McCammon.)Sara is a wonderful storyteller with an engaging narrative style, and Jacob is a colorful character with whom to build a story around.So, if you're a non-fiction snob like me or a fiction addict like my wife, you can't go wrong with this book. Highly recommended.,overall
This bumped Secret Life of Bees off the top of the my list for audiobooks. I LOVED this book and highly recommend it as an audiobook. It's like a one man play.,overall
This is my new favorite book. Besides being a GREAT story, I feel like I have made many new and interesting friends.  Sara Gruen demonstrates a gift for characterization.  Each character transcends his/her strengths and weaknesses to portray the good, the bad and the ugly of circus life in the post-depression era.  She truly captured the mystique of \running away to join the circus\ through her characterization.Jacob Jankowski's (the narrator & featured characher) sense of humor is priceless.  I found myself either chuckling out loud or squirming in disgust throughout his storytelling.I found the book difficult to put down; yet, I did not want it to end.If you don't read another book this summer, read this one.  You will experience a myriad of emotions--happiness, sadness, fury, longing, relief, distress, even enchantment. . .,overall
Not a book I would have picked to read, but it was selected for my bookclub.  Have to say I loved it, it reminded me of one of my favorite novels, Angle of Repose by Wallace Stegner, in it's effective use of flashbacks. The story is different and engrossing, showing a subculture rarely seen.  I didn't expect to like a book about the circus, but found it fascinating.,overall
I purchased this book as a gift for my daughter, which she loved She gave me a great review, therefore I can recommend the book to you.,overall
I couldn't put this book down - an excellent story, easy read and fun! Now I can't wait to see the movie!!,overall
What took me so long to discover this book?  I hadn't heard about it from anyone, just found it during a \browse.\  I've been looking for a good read for so long and \Water for Elephants\ was right there the whole time.  I can't wait to read Sara Gruen's other books and when I finish them, her new one should be available.  She brings to life the good, the bad and the ugly of the circus world and her characters are vivid and full of life.  I found myself completely engrossed in the characters and falling in love with the main animals.  I couldn't wait to get to the next page...and the end was worth the whole trip.  For me it was one of those books that I was sorry to finish.  Thank you, Sara Gruen, for the beautiful journey.,overall
Was an excellent read would not have chosen on my own but book club picked it & I enjoyed it .Would recommend it as a read to anyone.,overall
This is the best book I have read in a long time!  A great love story and a trip back in time to the 1930's, in the viewpoint of an elderly man.  An interesting look at circus life.  Also, I am not a member of PETA or anything, but I know many die hard animal lovers would appreciate this book also.,overall
The reality came from his voice when he was 90 and when he was 20. Absolutely enjoyable. The early circus, as it came to town was truly captured. Brought back old memories.,overall
Where to begin? A real page turner. I can't tell you how much housework i neglected to read this wonderful book. if you dont read anything else, you'll be fine with this one!,overall
I started reading \Water for Elephants\ on a Saturday night and before I knew it, I had read half the book in one sitting. Sara Gruen's protagonist Jacob Jankowski, carries you through the novel - both as a twenty-three year old who just walked out of his Vet exams and onto the Circus arena and as ninety-three year old man stuck in a nursing home. Gruen's flawless ability to capture Jacob's voice both as a young and old man are is one of the many strengths of her talents. The storyline, which is composed of coming-of-age, love and well a circus will draw you in and keep you till you eyes read over every last word. \Water for Elephants\ is a brilliantly, well-written and engrossing story that will appease to both men and women alike.,overall
I loved this book! I found it very easy to read and get lost in the story. I liked how it was told from present-day Jacob's view looking back on his life. This helped me understand what type of man he was. I felt like I was there will him throughout this story. The setting of the Great Depression made the struggles and triumphs mean so much more. I found all the main characters; Jacob, August, Marlena, Walter, and even the elephant, Rosie, to be extremely poignant, especially when you remember the story is told from an elderly Jacob. The transitions from \memories\ to \current day\ Jacob were very smooth and I didn't feel distracted or lost during these changes. If you love a romance novel with hero and heroine, then you must read this book!,overall
This was one of those books that caught my attention from the very start and had me continually wanting more. I can't tell you how sad I was to have finished this book so quickly! What an amazing read!!!,overall
No matter what your taste in books may be this title has something for everyone.  Fantastic writing!!,overall
I bought this book before i watched the movie and of course the book was WAY better than the movie. it is written beautifully and you instantly fall in love with the characters and feel their emotions.,overall
I LOVED this story!!!  What an amazing story-teller Ms. Gruen is.  I couldn't put this book down and absolutely loved every minute of reading this wonderful tale.My wish...Please make a movie out of this delightful book!!!,overall
I absolutely loved this book! I enjoyed the history, the animals and of course Jacob and Marlena. I'm an animal lover and was heartbroken the way some were treated in the book, but, you must realize this can be reality. Trust me justice is served for the animal cruelty. I plan to pull this book out next year and re-read! It's a keeper.,overall
What can I say, this book moved me. I saw the movie and put off reading the book, the movie wasn't bad but didn't inspire me to start reading.  Wow, am I glad I did! The transitions from depression time to the present left me breathless. The expertly told story played with all my emotions.  Left me with a renewed appreciation for the difficult times my parents and grandparents grew up in, yet made me want to experience them.  I couldn't put the book down until finished then I went to my computer, looked up old circus pictures and finally bought tickets to Ringling Brothers Circus later this summer.,overall
I used to love to read, however it has been ages since a book has captured me like this one did. The description of characters is both dear and terrible at times.  The description of the life with the circus in this time in history is fascinating. Not really for young readers, it is a bit lusty in some areas but not offensive to me. I have not experienced the movie yet, it will be a challenge to capture the quality of this  book.  I look forward to reading more of Sara Gruen novels.,overall
This is an \Indiana Jones\ action packed novel. Some things predictable, some things not. Great descriptions and an emotional attachment.,overall
I passed over this book many times but one day decided to take a chance. I was not expecting such a great read. Read the entire book in a day and was left wanting more. Such as, did they ever find Walter's and Camel's body after the train stopped? Did they ever capture or prosecute Blackie and his gang for murder? Wish I knew more. Maybe there will be a second book later. Meantime, for those of you not steeped in elitist review criticism, this book is a wonderful surprise.,overall
This is simply just a wonderful book!The characters are well defined, each and everyone of them!  You care, you like, you love, you hate!The story unfolds with Jacob, at 91 or 93...he is not sure, and his life.Schooled in vetinary science, he finds himself adrift after the loss of his parents and any financial stability.  He joins the circus and meets a cast of characterS like no other.His love for Marlena, his ultimate choices and growth...the paths taken...andThen...he is 91 or 93...just read it...I can't wait to see the movie...it will be magic!,overall
A wonderful story about a wonderful warm gentle human being through his words you see his life past and present  excellent book.,overall
Well written. I couldn't put this book down! A tragedy turned almost comical, back to tragic, resulting in excitement, laughter, and never ending love. I recommend reading the Q&A; after finishing the book - they are interesting.&#34;I said what I meant and I meant what I said. An elephants faithful one-hundred per cent.&#34; Dr. Suess' Horton Hears a WhoI appreciate the fact this quote was used in the beginning of this book. The ties it makes to the story line are perfect.,overall
I haven't seen the movie (I wanted to read the book first). I loved this story line. Very entertaining and such a fanastic ending. I really enjoyed it. I can't wait to see how the movie compares.,overall
I must say that Water for Elephants was a great read.  A heartwarming story, I can relate to the story line of the nursing home, I work in one, and it put some laughter into the book. This was recommended to me by my Sister's friend.  I am glad to have purchased this one.  Sara Gruen did one excellent job.  Thank you Sara,overall
After debating whether or not I wanted to read this..it came up as a free book for prime members..so I thought what the heck. I absolutely loved it, even with the prices of violence here and there. It was a great story, with a happy ending,overall
Very well written.  A fascinating story about the circus folks of the 1930's.  This book will make you laugh and cry.,overall
This was a great book-had a hard time putting it down at night.Now to see if the movie is half as good!!,overall
I wasn't sure about getting this book, but once I started reading itI didn't want it to stop.  It was heart-wrenching in many ways.  I wasso sorry that the family failed to see past the old man's age, butthe ending made up for it all!,overall
This is one of the best books I have read in a while.  I loved the characters and the talent of the author to intertwine them with the story line.  I could not put the book down and hated when it ended.  I have not seen the movie yet, and am not sure I want to since I enjoyed the book so much.  I would highly recommend it.,overall
Loved this book-kinda kept you on your toes,going from Old to young but was totally enthralling and somewhat historical... what a rough kind of life to have lived. Want to see the movie but glad I read the book first. Yeah for Kindle-I haven't read a book in YEARS.,overall
What a ride ! Well written with exquisite detail.  The characters are as rich and colorful as the romance of the circus itself. What child has not dreamed of running away to join the circus?  I couldn't put this book down until the last page read. This story has everything, romance, villians, murder, mystery, friendship, compassion....oh yes, and an elephant. Wonderful, wonderful end. Thank you Ms. Gruen.,overall
This is not just a good summer read. It's a good (no, make that excellent) all-season read. I won't go into the plot because other reviewers have done it, and done it well. Suffice it to say, this book had me in its clutches from beginning to end, and the story has stayed with me ever since that last page was turned. In addition to Rosie (the most endearing elephant this side of Horton and Dumbo), Gruen's circus characters grab hold of you and refuse to let go. I was particularly enamored of Kinko/Walter and the way his relationship with Jacob developed over the course of this compelling story.The writing is rich and fulfilling, full of texture. This novel will engage all your senses. You will see the big top and hear the guys pounding in the stakes. You will smell the animals, the aroma of fresh sawdust and breakfast cooking. And you will feel the same pleasure and pain the characters feel as they take your hand and lead you into the world of a Depression era circus.As for how Gruen, a young woman, managed to get herself into the head of a 93-year-old man? Well, isn't that what superbly talented authors do? Transport you to places you never thought you'd ever go?I'll be looking forward, eagerly, to her next novel.,overall
I loved Water for Elephants.  I have always been interested in circus folk, and their lives behind the scenes.  This story follows a young vet's life working with the circus during the depression years. The great depression also interests me, so the book fit me to a tee!,overall
I have a soft spot for elephants and had compassion for this big one.  Plus it is a wonderful, well written love story with lots of action of the emotional kind.  Great book,overall
This story line captivated me from the first chapter.  It had ALOT of swearing and graphic sexual content which I didn't enjoy having to wade through and skip over.  I didn't think it added anything to the storyline, and felt that it could have been left out all together.I found the author commentaries at the end to be most fascinating.  It was interesting to read that the story line has some non-fiction events weaved into it.  I you don't mind filthy language and sexual content this is a great read.,overall
Nothing about this book appealed to me.  Not the subject matter, nor the title, nor the cover.  Pfttt.....nothing. A depression-era traveling circus?  What could be more....depressing?  My sister delivered into my hands one day and said, \Read it.\  And I did.  I read it while cooking. I read it while eating.  I read it when I should have been sleeping.  I read and read and wanted to read more.  Now I hand it to you and say, \Read it\.  You won't be sorry.,overall
I really enjoyed this book. While reading it, I felt the author either had experience with a circus did a great job researching the material. The old man telling his life story caught my imagination right away and I couldn't put it down. Loved the detail and the story line. I felt I was back in history.,overall
This is an immersive, addictive, intricately researched novel that transports the reader to dusty, hardscrabble depression-era US. Young Jacob Jankowski flees his veterinarian final exams at Cornell when he learns of his parents' accidental death. Faced with sudden poverty when the bank takes his parents' possessions, he starts walking with no destination in mind, and jumps a circus train in the middle of the night. The inner world of the circus unfolds around him as he learns of the class divide between the workers and performers, the fragility of the circus' desperate illusions, and the economic vulnerability of everyone on the show. He becomes the show's vet and befriends monkeys, tigers, horses, and one oppressed but ultimately triumphant elephant.Sara Gruen is a master of plot, building to a suspenseful climax and weaving together her storylines with tidbits and gems from her research on American circuses. She respectfully explores her characters' strengths and weaknesses, ultimately delivering an honest and intricate portrait of a difficult time in US history. This book was a 100% satisfying read.,overall
Great book.  bought this for my kindle and started it but am so busy I barely have time to read for pleasure.  great book,overall
This is the first book in a long time that I feel lives up to it's hype.  Never read this author before but that is about to change.  I \feel\ Jacob both as a young man and the man in the nursing home.  Being of an age that usually is in a nursing home, this is a great insight into them and I hope everyone who reads it will feel what I am feeling.,overall
I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a great story.  An interesting glance into the old circus life during the hay day for circuses.,overall
This is a must read for any circus lover. If you have a thing for elephants, this is your book.,overall
I loved this book.  An intriguing peek behind the scenes of a (fictional) circus in the early 20th century.  I thoroughly enjoyed it - well-paced, GREAT characters, and an interesting plot.  I highly recommend it!,overall
this book was recomeneded to me by a relative.  we have an age gap and she is old enough to be my grandma.  we both loved the book it is a good read for all adult ages.,overall
Water for Elephants was a great book - it had me flipping the pages whenever I had a spare moment.  I would highly recommend this entertaining book!,overall
What a wonderful adventure!  I read this book in 2 days.  From the first page I was charmed.  The scenes played out so vividly in my head.  I am thinking that in my old age (someday), I will think I was really there!  Just fabulous!!,overall
it's been a very long time that I do this, see a movie AND buy the book!..that's how much I just loved this story & I know the book is better.The movie is good, I think Reese was miscast for some \visceral\ feeling of mine!That part is so \meaty\ and I don't know who but she did not fill the shoes for me..Patterson was incredible and the production incredibleCheers..Tony(NYC),overall
Loved this story!  I did read the book before I saw the movie.  The movie was well done, but of course the book has so many more details!  Read this book!,overall
I enjoyed this book so much it nearly read itself.  Skillfully weaves in a mystery as well as some hard truths about bumming the rails during the depression. Does for the circus what Daniel Mannix's Memoirs of a Sword Swallower did for carnivals.,overall
Others have reviewed the store line much more in depth and better than I can here. I loved this book. Once I started reading it, I didn't put it down. This is not a silly little beach read as it has been touted. It is more in depth than that.The characters were believable. They didn't do anything that was totally out of character once their basic personality was developed. The setting was realistic and interesting and a vital part of the story. The ending was surprising.Very well written. Very interesting. Worth the time to read and worth the money.Enjoy.,overall
I enjoyed reading Water For Elephants very much. There is excitement, love, sadness, and fills you full of empathy while reading. You begin to feel as though you are a worker on the carnival train going from town to town following the drama and excitement. One of the best books I have read.,overall
It has been a while since I read this, but remember it as a great story with action, love and experience in this occupation.,overall
Probably was one of the last I know to read this but was well worth the wait...sickened me how they treated the  animals, seemed like a realistic look into the circus life. sad but satisfying read.,overall
Loved the book, the setting reminded me of the HBO series Carnivale. Read the book in one day because I could not put it down.,overall
Water for Elephants is truly an excellent read. The story is narrated by Jacob Jankowski, well the 93 year old version and the 23 year old version. The young Jankowski joined a traveling circus in depression-era America after the sudden death of his parents. With his veterinary background, Jacob is put in charge of the filthy, underfed and sometimes abused animals. The Benzini Bros. traveling circus is everything one would imagine a circus to be-dirty, crazy, and full of all kinds of different folks. Workers are apt to disappear in the night (thrown from the train, no longer able to be paid). It is obvious that Gruen did her homework on traveling circuses. Her terminology is spot-on and her vivid description is exquisite. The stand out characters are August the animal trainer, Marlena (his wife and a performer in the circus), and of course Rosie, the elephant. Gruen weaves together a story that is at times hilarious, heartwrenching, touching, warm, sad and so moving. The ending is perfect, and I could not have asked for a more enjoyable read.,overall
Water for Elephants presents a story of a veterinarian's life told from both his present and earlier life perspective.  The way that the author switched between time periods was entertaining.  I found myself experiencing a wide range of emotions from horror to curiosity to anger and then to happiness.  I personally have never been to a circus so I don't have any memories of my own to go by.  However, the author's descriptions of the circus atmosphere and \class\ system within the different groups makes it very easy to imagine just how life was living on that train traveling from town to town.  I really enjoyed reading this book and look forward to the film version.,overall
This book is so delightful.  I cared about the characters right away - Sara Gruen knows how to portray people well.  The story was compelling and the world of circus people so different from the one the rest of us live in, it was fascinating.,overall
Wow, I loved this sorry of the 1920's circus life...I also loved how it related to a person's life in a nursing home.  The surprise ending was just right for me, as I like to be uplifted and happy with the ending.  this writer is fabulous and I will want to read more of her work!,overall
I will never forget when I read this, I could not put it down and it stayed with me for days. It is fantastic story with fantastic characters. Sara Gruen has created something magical.If you enjoy Water for Elephants I also recommend The Night Circus by Erin Morganstern.,overall
I really enjoyed this book. It was slow to get into but with all these great reviews I pressed on. It was worth it. Read it!!!!!!!,overall
I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I likes how the author would go from present date to the past. I thought the plot was very exciting and interesting. From the title of it, I would have never have guessed what this book was really about. I would definitely recommend this boom to everyone. It was an easy read and I think many would enjoy it too.,overall
I absolutely loved this book; it will definitely be a re-read.  I read this book before I saw the movie but knowing which actor was playing what character, I could definitely create a mental image of them and it definitely made the story that much better.  If you're one of those who likes to see a movie before reading the book (or just seeing the movie) that will work just fine but I'd still recommend reading the book.,overall
This book is a grotesque fairytale. It's both charming and disturbing, and it will stay with you for a long time after you put it down.,overall
This book was very moving for me.  The way Gruen writes about the older character seemed so very well done.  Even though I am not old, I felt older reading those passages.  Gruen moves back and forth from present day to the past very smoothly and it is always a seamless transition for the reader.  Great story, good characters, loved Rosie the elephant. Very thought provoking and I really adored the old carny photographs sprinkled throughout the book.  Never thought I would enjoy a depression era book, but this one was really well done.,overall
I avoided this book for a while due mainly to the over-hype by various celebrity talk show hosts. In the end , however, it is worth all the acclaim. Excellent reading, wonderful book.,overall
The book was an excellent read.  It was very well written and gave you a good picture of life in the circus in the l930's.,overall
WATER FOR ELEPHANTS by Sara GruenThis is a marvelous book that covers the two bookends of the long adventurous life of Jacob Jankowski, going back and forth from him as a ninety-plus-year old in an assisted living facility, to him thinking back to his days working on the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a circus that moved around the country in its own train.He is all alone in the nursing home, with most the employees viewing him as more trouble than he is worth, except for one wonderful nurse named Rosemary, who shows him respect and compassion, and is for all practical purposes his only friend at this point in his life. While he has many family members, his children are now old themselves and the family in general has moved on without him. They take turns visiting him, but he gets the feeling their hearts are not into it.Mr. Jankowski maintains his sanity by thinking back to his days as a young man in his prime. The story into the past begins with him finishing up veterinary school at Cornel. His plan is to join his father's practice, but, just before he finishes his final exam, he gets the news that his parents have been killed in a car wreck. To add to the tragedy, he finds out that his parents were bankrupt and losing their family house and everything they own, a result of the bad economy and them putting all their money into Jacob's education at Cornel. He responds by joining the Benzini Brothers Greatest Show on Earth.His journey down memory lane provides us a rich assortment of protagonists and antagonists, and a loving, touching account of the animals that were under his care as the official veterinarian of the circus. He falls in love with the star of the circus, but she is married to a brute, having been sold off to him while she was still a child. Jacob has constant run ins with her lover, as the man is in charge of training the animals for the circus acts. The man is a barbarian, often mistreating the animals, his wife, the workers, and he and Jacob rumble several times.The owner of the circus is a two-bit conman that often physically abuses his workers, and more often than not--it seems--fails to pay them. This of course leads to great friction with the working men, some of whom disappear during some of the train rides, thrown off the moving train under the orders of the mad man in charge of the circus.Along the way, the circus picks up a prized elephant, named Rosie, who does not respond to any commands and is judged to be a worthless animal with an alarming appetite. The trainer responds by beating the elephant on several occasions. Jacob intervenes and figures out the elephant responds to Polish, which provides the circus new life, with Rosie emerging as the star of the circus, along with Jacob's love, Marlena.There are several wonderful side stories that outline the struggles of the wonderful array of characters that make up the circus crew. They travel around in the Depression, attempting to survive when most circuses are folding their tents and going out of business.I loved the ninety-plus-year old Jacob and especially his flashbacks to earlier days that showed the wonders, dangers, opportunities, underhandedness, splendors and tragedies of life on the train circus. The story tells how difficult it is to age, to become old, to be viewed as no longer capable of living a normal life. It also is a story that tells us to follow our dreams when we are young and do all we can to make them come true.Ms. Gruen provides a fitting ending to the book. I will not spoil it for you, but you are certain to like and appreciate it.This is a wonderful book that I highly recommend.Hey Joe (Jamaica Series),overall
Sure \Water for Elephants\ has been around and even turned into a movie, but I've only just now read the book.  I'll have to go and see the movie . . . if only to see the director's interpretation of the glorious scenes of circus life this book conjures up in the reader's mind.Judging by the number of people who took time out to write reviews for this book, I must say it lives up to the critical acclaim in just about every way possible.  At least for this reader it did. Every writer knows that in order to keep the readers' attention a novel must have tension on every page.  This novel is almost the illustration of that rule.  I loved taking the trip.  I highly recommend this book to almost anyone.  I think it will become a classic.This is masterful writing and I've passed it on to my sister who is now devouring it whole.  Congratulations to Sara Gruen for producing this stunning page-turner.  I absolutely loved it!5 Stars.  Great Read!,overall
This book was suggested to me by a friend and I wasn't sure I would like it. As soon as I started reading I couldn't put it down.  In fact, I read it in about a week.  This particular book earned it's place on the New York Bestsellers list for a reason.An elderly man, looking back on the past and how it has shaped him now.  The book is set in the present day as well as the early 1930's.  It paints the picture of exactly what I would think a traveling circus would be during that time.  It is full of drama within in the reigns of the circus as far as the everyday workers, performers, and animals. From cover to cover the reader does not know exactly what to expect.  I would suggest this book to anyone.One of the best books I have read in some time.  I can't wait to see the movie!,overall
I normally don't select bestsellers for reading pleasure; they so often disappoint. Had my book club not selected this for discussion I probably would not have read it. But I am so glad I did. The book is well writen, not just a good story, but excellent writer's craft. Any person over fifty with any empathy at all will identify with the story teller. Younger people will identify with the main characters in the circus story. I am not particularly interested in circus history, but this was fascinating. The ending is especially wonderful...fanciful but wonderful.,overall
This book is as advertised. I meant to pick it up a while ago and then bought it after seeing previews of the movie. Highly recommend.,overall
This is the perfect example of a good book really being about HOW the story is told. It's a good story, but the author's skill in making this a captivating read is undeniable. Read it!,overall
True to Amazon.com order came on time and in perfect condition. If you have not read this book, read it!! Had read in on my Kindle and wanted hard copy for my book shelves.,overall
I'm not a real fan of fiction, only because fiction does not keep me tuned in to the story line. Often the subject matter rambles on before the story line gets going when  you finally know what you are reading about.Water for Elephants is a well written novel. The title fascinated me to begin with, and excerpts led me to believe this was going to be a good read. I was right!  The story line is never boring, it's uncomplicated, and keeps you tuned in to events as they unravel. So well done. I encourage anyone who is an avid reader to buy a copy. You won't be disappointed.,overall
What a wonderful read!! Once I got into the book I was lost on a train in a circus and I never wanted to leave my new world.  I really enjoyed this book and would reccomend it to everybody that enjoys a good read.  I was also excited that the train went through my towns of Keokuk, Hamilton, and Burlington how exciting!!!!!,overall
A truly fascinating novel - for those of us old enough to remember going to the circus in small towns during the summer and now old enough to share the anxiety and depression of aging it covered the whole gamut.  Only the treatment of both animals and those on the low end of the pay scale could be considered distracting from the good memories.,overall
Book Was Great. Easy to read & follow. Circus Drama page turner with a love story. I thought Rosie was brilliant !!,overall
I read this book on my Kindle.  It was the first e-book I ordered, avout 2 years ago.  I don't know why my review has been so delayed, but this truly is a marvelous love story!  No wonder it was on the best-seller list for so long.  I would recommend reading the book before you see the movie as the author's ability to describe the scenes and emotions is a fascinating read.,overall
This book was a fantastic read, absolutely wonderful.  I was hooked from the moment I began reading and didn't put it down until I was finished with it!,overall
This story is now in my top 10 best loved stories.  Now that says something!!!!Jacob Jankowski is a cranky but very likable 93 yr old man who lives in an assisted living center.He is strong willed and has opinions on so many of the other people who live in the centre with him. His body has degenerated and he doesn't want to look in the mirror any more as he does not reconise himself anymore.  He becomes the trouble maker of the group as his mind is sharp  not like his degenerated body.Jacob remembers the circumstances under which he found himself homeless and travelling with the Benzini Brothers Circus. He alternates between the past and his day to day living with his co-workers of the circus going weeks without being paid, and some nights some workers would disappear during the night (the bosses would organise for them to be thrown off a moving train). He sleeps on a horse blanket on the train floor just thankful for a meal and a job.1931 is a hard time during the depression and everyone will do anything just to survive.The world couldn't be any tougher for this young man.This is one of the most moving stories i have ever listened to on Audio cd.A must for everyones collection.,overall
I just finished reading Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen.  It was one of my most favorite reads to date, and I read alot of books!  I loved how the book started in the nursing home with the older Jacob and how he reveiled how it felt to be old and most of the time forgotten.  His family viewed it as a duty to go and visit him..And then it switches to a young Jacob and tells the story of his adventures working in a circus.  For anyone who wanted to run away to the circus as a child, you will definately love this book.  I could not put it down. It is exciting one minute and has you on the edge of your seat and the next it is endearing and makes you feel like you really know the characters.  I give this book 5 stars and if you want a really good read, you will do the same.,overall
After \Riding Lessons\, which I loved - and \Flying Changes\, which was a huge disappointment to me, I was not sure what I would find in \Water for Elephants\.  Wow - what a great read!  Research does pay off hugely - when it enables a writer to place the reader inside another world so easily - the world of the circus. This was a world totally foreign to most of us - but now, so familiar, thanks to Sara.  This book satisfied my three requirements - transportation (take me away from all this),  levitation (lift my spirits and leave me thinking good thoughts) and infiltration (let me get inside the characters so I feel I really know them). Reading \Water for Elephants\ is time well-spent.  I'm happy to know Sara is working on a fourth book. I'll be first in line to buy it.,overall
Great summer read,overall
Quite delightful - for all ages, teens, and adults - - - a good book to give as a gift  - a surefire read. Barbara Pontecorvo,overall
On a scale of one to ten, I rate this book a ten.  It is a very unusual story and makes for a good satisfying read.  The characters really come alive in this book and you can almost picture the circus.  This would make a great movie!,overall
I was reluctant to read this book because I'm not a fan of the circus. While there is animal cruelty in here, you also see how people who traveled with the circus were treated in much the same way as the animals. The ending is a nice surprise. Jacob and Rosie will stay with you for a long time.,overall
I couldn't put this book down, from the first page to the last, I was swept away with every detail of Circus life and then back to the reality of Mr. Jankowski.  I would recommend this book highly for anyone who enjoys stories of the past put against today's reality.Thank you for a good read.,overall
I enjoyed this book as evidenced by the fact that it only took me a few days to read.  The characters are engrossing and realistic.  It is amazing that Sara was able to write the part of an old man with such realism. When I read a book, I also like to learn well researched real facts. This book did not disappoint in that area. The history is interesting and accurate.  The end of the book is satisfying.  If you would like to \get lost\ in a great book, this is a good choice.,overall
This book is for those aching for just a good story to read.  A great piece of fiction.  Set in the Depression, there are intriguing, indepth and sometimes horrific details about Circus life intertwined in a simple but classic love story.you will love to turn the page to find out what else can happen to the character.Dont wait to read this!! This book is a sure thing.,overall
I was a bit hesitant about reading this book, I kept reading that it was about circuses, and I really didn't think I had too much of and interest. Boy was I wrong. It starts with a murder and winds and weaves you through the story of life in the traveling circus and back to present day in a nursing home.  The book had my attention from page one and still has me even though I finished reading it. There is humor, love, murder, and friendship, and a whole lot of history about the circus, and circus life making this book a well rounded engaging read.,overall
I think this is the first book I have read just because everyone else seemed to be reading it. Usually that is not a very good recommendation. I am glad I did not miss it because of my rather arragant opinion of other peoples reading tastes.,overall
I loved this story.  The story is entertaining and the reading is relaxing.  I highly recommend this book.,overall
This one of those watch the movie before you read the book! Cause I did it the other way around and kept waiting for things from the book! I loved the book, I read my sister's copy and then decided I needed a copy of my own. And I am rereading it and loving it even more!,overall
A couple of years ago a friend gave me a copy of Water For Elephants. I put it aside until a few days ago, at which time I thought I should probably read it. I was hooked from the very beginning and couldn't put the book down. Although, I have never been interested in elephants, I fell in love with Rosie and her sweet personality. Did you know that elephants cry and that they have a huge hippocampus, a brain structure that's important in processing emotions? After finishing the book, I immediately Googled elephants to learn more about these intelligent animals. Water For Elephants has become one of my favorite novels. If you haven't read this one, you are definitely missing a modern classic.,overall
This is one of my favorite books! I love it so much I gave it to 5 people as gifts!!!,overall
Entertaining plot, engaging characters portrayed in sufficient depth.  I've not seen the movie, so I can't make that particular comparison.  But I can vouch that the novel stands on its own.  Makes me want to read another novel by this author.,overall
I loved getting to know each character and could not put the book down. This is a must read for anyone.,overall
This book is absolutely charming and endearing.  It combines romance and hatred, excitement and terror.  It's a well written story that goes back and forth from  a sometimes cranky 90-something year old man and his 23 year old self.  I highly recommend it for teens and up.,overall
This is about a circus around in the 30's. It is a good book. You would like it too. I would recomment it.,overall
This is such a delightful story. I laughed, I cryed. I loved all the characters. It really gave you a peak into the lives of circus life and the difficulties they endure as well as the relationships. Great read whether hard copy or audio. I highly recommend reading it.,overall
This book is fascinating.  Not only a good book but a lesson on early 20th century America.  Classically written!,overall
My husband read this book and really enjoyed it, and he doesn't read very often. Now I need to read, sometime in the near future.,overall
This was a fascinating story of interesting times gone by. I couldn't put it down. I loved the way the old man went back to recall the events of his young years. The circus story was so believable.,overall
I read this book from the library before it was made into a movie... I fell in love with it and that is why I purchased this book for my Kindle..... Great book!!,overall
I am so very glad that my mom insisted I read this book.  I typically shy away from stories about the elderly because it is a topic that affects me very deeply and can really be painful to read.  But after I helped care for my 92 year-old grandmother in the week before her death, my mom told me I had to read this and that I'd love it.  She wasn't wrong.The story gripped me immediately with the scene in the menagerie tent.  But I have to say that what I loved the most about this novel was the narrator, Jacob Jankowski.  I fell hard and fast for him from the very first page.  because of this, I purposely read this book slowly so that I wouldn't have to say goodbye to Jacob.  Ms. Gruen did an amazing job not only portraying the life of this man and the interesting friends and enemies he makes while being the vet for a travelling circus, but showing that the elderly have amazing stories to tell.  It showed how dignity is in danger of being lost when elderly people are treated like children once they are of a certain age, but also how so many simple things can bring that dignity back.This book was so wonderful and I found the ending to be uplifting and appropriate and extremely well done.  I wouldn't have accepted any less for this wonderful, amazing character.,overall
This author has captured the essence of what it must feel like to be an old man who is still sharp-as-a-tack and remembers, with vivid detail, a few short months of his long life.  This book is written with clear attention to detail and descriptions of what life very well may have been like with a train circus during Prohibition and the Great Depression.  In addition to the day-to-day goings on there is the added element of several plot lines of a personal nature with feelings of love, loss, joy and sorrow.  Each character is seen from Jacob's point of view and drawn so clearly that you feel you know them personally. I want Jacob to be my friend and so will you!Definitely a book I will be recommending to most everyone!  I only wish there had not been the need for a few relatively explicit scenes as those few make this book unsuitable for my 11-year-old.  She is a voracious reader and wants to be a writer.  She could learn a thing or two about research and character development from this excellent and enjoyable book!,overall
Very good storyline and book.  I would recommend this book to  everybody. Nice job on a great book. Thank you,overall
I will be reviewing this book for our women's book club. It was a joy to read a realistic book with such a sense of humor built in. The young narrator grows and matures and skillfully helps other people and animals as well. The ending is a surprise and another delight in a most charming read!,overall
I really loved this book. I saw the movie before the book but it was one that once I saw the movie had to read the book.,overall
I truly enjoyed this book.  I loved Jacob as an older man,remembering his youth.  It was very well written and kept my interest from beginning to the end.  I also enjoyed the notes at the end, detailing her research experiences.  I love ELEPHANTS and enjoyed the authors characterzation of Rosie.  The people all had very interesting and different personalities.,overall
Jacob Jankowsky is 90...or 93.  He can never remember.  As the book begins, he is a \resident\ in an assisted living facility, so I related to it right off, having just spent 2 days with my mother-in-law at an assisted living facility.  As Jacob begins to look backward, we discover that he was \orphaned\ as he was getting ready to take his exams for his veterinary license and join his father's practice.  When his parents are killed in an auto accident, he is left with no money and, through an accidental twist of fate, he joins a circus, where he becomes the resident veterinarian.  Over the next four months he learns the good and the bad about circus life, falls in love, discovers the secret of the newly acquired \stupid\ elephant, and witnesses the one of the worst circus disasters in history.Gruen is a wonderful writer, with a rich use of language which paints vivid pictures of a world most of us have never experienced.  This is a riveting story with a couple of surprising twists at the end that I didn't see coming.I highly recommend this book.,overall
The novel is sure a pleasant surprise. First, I like how the author interlaces the novel between the perspective of the older and younger antagonists. Mr Jankowski is animated and adorable. I felt like I could really take a glimpse inside an old person's mild. He is a young guy trapped in an old man's body. Jacob is young and innocent, but not as memorable as his older self. The adventure he had is almost like Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. Sure, there were times I was confused. It doesn't seem so believable to have a college graduate jumping from one railcar to another, and the sex scene is unnecessarily. (I guess female readers demand certain rewards with reading romance novels.) {Spoiler Alert} I still don't understand why Uncle Al needs August for the circus. It seems like Uncle Al could have just replaced August with Jacob and the novel will shortened by half.I wish Ms Gruen all the best and am looking forward to her coming books.,overall
Good book. I liked the movie, but  I loved the book...Slow read but a good read. It had much more information,overall
This is the story of Jacob J from two points of view - Jacob the old man, in the \assisted living\ facility and Jacob the young man, newly orphaned, trying to make his way in the world.Jacob the elder is a grumpy old curmudgeon. And, as you read the book, from his POV, you understand why. His body has failed him, his mind isn't as sharp as it was, and his keepers treat him like a child. He is unbelievably frustrated. But he has a family that visits him regularly, and he has something to look forward to. The circus has come to town.Seeing the circus has taken him back to his youth, during the depression, when he ran away from life and joined the circus. The chapters that take place during this point in time are riveting, capturing the essence of what we could never experience.There's mystery, romance, and some really great characters. And, I think the author does a good job of capturing the essence of this proud male character. Great read.,overall
Seeing Jacob young and old, and hearing how time affected him, and how he still remained connected to his history after all those years was  great. It really added to the book and really tied the story together for me. It was very dramatic for me to see how this once active and interesting man was effected by the years, and what age does to a person. It made me think how we cast aside many of our elderly friends and folks not paying attention to their stories. Especially key when thinking alone about Jacob's past. I have a great love and respect for elephants and at many times i was so angered in the story and could feel the emotions that Jacob was experiencing. It was such a strong event that occurred with Rosie, and without giving the story away was vindicating. Really don't want to watch the movie now as afraid would not live up to how i imagined everything or if they changed the story too much.,overall
This book is firmly positioned in my top 10 best reads ever. A riveting plot with full, rich characters (including the animals), written in simple yet powerful prose. The way in which the two storylines (old Jacob and young Jacob) are intertwined is masterful, and the conclusion of each, equally satisfying. A truly wonderful book.,overall
Great and dramatic character development, some you love, some you care about, some you hate and one or two you simply loathe...great characters living life with all of its pathos, humor and drama in a Depression era circus...Some points will make you laugh out loud, some smile in suprise and some where you want to say, \That sorry, no good SOB...\  Some will make you gasp in joy and delight, one or two in horror. All in all, a very good book....The characters, the pathos and the humor, the living of life, make it come alive and stay with you long after the last page is turned.  I was sorry to seen it end, and that is the way a good book is supposed to leave you. This one is good, though it never really talks about or explains the title \Water for Elephants...\,overall
I never would have read a book about the circus but this was recommended by a friend and I loved it. Don't let the subject matter distract you from a great novel!,overall
I ended up caring deeply about the characters and the narrative was strong.  The setting of the novel in a circus was a stroke of genius.  The writing was strong and fluid, not masterwork material though.  But hey, if you want to read a masterpiece read one.,overall
The perfect ending in any book I have read in a loing time. What looked like a sad ending turned out to be inspiring instead. I must say I adore this book.,overall
Best book I've read in a while. Interesting, unusual, great characters. Once again pointing out the incredible spread of compassion and evil that humans are capable of. The book felt very real but also had times where it was magical. Loved it.,overall
I was a little reluctant to read this as the context of a circus didn't excite me.  But on the recommendation of a friend, I picked it up.  I was quickly drawn into the story and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The ending was a bit of a stretch, but having been drawn into the characters, it was still satisfying.,overall
Loved this book.  Thought it might be depressing in the beginning but soon became gripped in the twists and turns off the plot.  Quite a colorful ride.,overall
Definately in my top ten favorites of all time!!! I read it in a day and a half!!,overall
Seldom has a book moved me as much as this one did.  Perhaps it's because I listened to the audiobook version, and the narrators voices were perfect for the different stages of life in the book.  Perhaps it's because my 98 year old mother-in-law is in a nursing home, but the author captured what life for a 90+ year old must be like in a nursing home facility.  In addition, I LOVE the circus, even though today's pale in comparison to those that were under canvas.  Without doing a spoiler, I can only say that it's been a long time since the ending of a book brought tears to my eyes.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.,overall
This novel was absolutely fabulous.  I liked the way the author bounced back and forth from the past to the present.  I could really feel the many struggles the characters were having by the way the author got into their minds.  Terrific story with interesting photos to make it so real.,overall
What a great story! My wife has been wanting to watch the movie so I had to hurry up and read the book. It is a very charming love story played out on the set of a traveling circus. The times are hard, but true love for both people and animals finds a way to shine through. Loved, loved the ending!,overall
Very good story. I liked the story being told from the old man's memories and his current life. It is a story rich with characters.,overall
WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a sweeping story of nearly epic proportions that touches on the young, the old, and lost loves, all within one man's life.His name is Jacob Janowski, a grumbling old 93-year-old (or is it 90-year-old?) fart living in an old folks home. Enduring his final days with other old folks, Jacob loathes his surroundings and how he is treated by the medical staff. Then, one day, a circus sets up stakes not far from Jacob's retirement facility and memories of life-gone-by come flooding back to him.We time-travel with Jacob (in his mind, not the science fiction kind), and learn of a short span that changed Jacob's life. Preparing for his final exams in veterinary school, Jacob soon learns of his parents' demise in a deadly car accident. Running away from his problems, Jacob joins up with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Hired on initially as a rube, Jacob's talents with animals soon come to light and he's assigned as the shows official vet. But trouble, love, and loss await him as he travels the rails with the show. Falling for a married woman, trying to fit in with the grunts versus the performers, battling the show's muscle-bound brutes that carry out Uncle Al's orders (Uncle Al owns the show) and trying to keep from being red-lighted (being thrown from the train), Jacob's short stint in the circus circuit changes everything about him.Author Sara Gruen's easy reading style lends itself to a fast, fun, and interesting read. It also, surprisingly, has a ton of character depth, and not just for human characters but for the animals Jacob tends. Particularly that of Rosie the \dumb as hammers\ elephant that turns out to be much, much more than what she seems.The ending to WATER FOR ELEPHANTS was absolutely perfect, letting us know that even though the elderly can be crotchety, they serve a much greater purpose than to be wheeled around in chairs and told when, what and where to eat, drink, and think. Finding a home where one belongs is the toughest thing when people get older, and it was a fantastic ending for Jacob to \go home\ to when the final sentence gets read.,overall
LOVED LOVED LOVED this book, and the author paints such a wonderful, detailed picture of each character, no matter how profound to the story. I could not put this book down.If you are offended by sexual content or 'colorful' language, maybe it's not the best read for you. But understand that the content is part of the raw nature of the circus life during that time.,overall
Rarely do I enjoy books that are recommended to me as much as I enjoyed Sara Gruen's 'Water For Elephants'. A charming, touching, entertaining read from start to finish; the book's frequent 'travels in time' from a depression era college boy experiencing loss and uncertainty at a young age to a 90+ year old man also experiencing loss and uncertainty, while reliving his past and trying desperately to maintain as much dignity as possible in face of his diminishing capacity with old age.The story begins with the older Jacob Jankowski, infuriated with a newer resident at his assisted living facility who, with the advent of a circus arriving nearby, delights and entertains his female dining hall companions with stories of how he carried water for elephants at the circus in his younger years. Jacob; who is incensed at this obviously false claim, and alienates himself from the rest of the residents, begins to relive, through a series of remembrances in his mind, his own experiences in the Benzini Brothers circus in his youth.With a cast as colorful as the balloons and flags that you can imagine flying over the bigtop of the Benzini Brothers circus, Jacob's internal narrative weaves a tale of love, loss, betrayal, and murder that is as fine a coming of age story as I have ever read.A thoroughly enjoyable read from start to finish.,overall
Love love love this book. This book is so much more than I thought it would be. Its beautiful, exciting, eye opening, and intriguing. I fell in love with the story and its characters from the beginning. Favorite character of all?... Rosie for sure... yes the elephant. Shes innocent, smart, witty, out smarts her humans and seemingly has a wonderful personality. She is amazing. But of course this book is not just about an elephant. Its about love, hate, excitement, tyranny, rage, and some real good laughs. Definitely a book worth reading.,overall
I loved this book. In fact I also listened to it on cd. Gives you a idea how circus life was or could beI am no expert on circus life but my husband worked on some. Can be fun and hard,overall
I was really impressed by this book. It's an old man's retelling of his younger days at a circus. He's currently in a nursing home. What's amazing is how she takes you inside his head and causes you to see events through his eyes, and his mind. You feel his frustration, his loneliness, and how he's misunderstood.Older people in the home are treated like children, but inside, they're cognizant, at least some of the time, and resent this treatment, but are helpless to prevent it.The details in the circus era are very well written. You're taught a lot about circus life, the fun, the dangerous, the dark underbelly. Maybe it's not representative; it is fiction, but you believe it. She takes you there.One of the most enjoyable fiction books I've read.,overall
I Bought this one on a whim as my favorite authors seemed to have dried up a little. I'm so glad I did, it's wonderful.Jacob Jankowski is 93 (hr thinks) and in an old folks home put out to pasture. He has an enthralling story inside him that many of us only wish we had. Dropping out of college and running away with the circus as a young man, his story unfolds as a true adventure.The circus of the 30's is the back drop for this wonderful yarn and we follow Jacob as he navigates his way around the people, the lore, the language and the pecking order. All the characters are colorful and each brings a dimension to the story that has the reader turning pages as fast as possible. I think I blew through this one in two days. I might have done it in one had I not had commitments I had to keep.The story is interspersed with up to date goings on at the old folks home the aged Jankowski is a resident of but, you can just tell his heart is still on the circus train of his youth. The end of the book is perfect in its simplicity and \rightness\.To say I thoroughly enjoyed this book would somehow understate the whole experience, to say I loved it would be closer to the truth. If you want something to read that will draw you in like a moth to a flame, this might just be the book. If you want to be taken back to a bygone age of Americana complete with all its misgivings and mayhem, this might be the story. If you want to immerse yourself in a great story that, I hope becomes a movie, this IS the book.,overall
I generally do not usually read these types of stories... I am mostly a Sci-Fi apocalyptic fan. My husband and I read this together and actually I was quite pleased with this Novel and enjoyed it very much! I found the Authors note at the end very interesting! It is a great Read! I recommend it!,overall
I thoroughly enjoyed this story.  I'm a voracious reader however never read a story about the circus - I found it delightful and satisfying.  The characters were powerful and colorful.  However - being a middle-aged reader it certainly didn't make me look forward to old age!  Nevertheless - a wonderful read - you won't be disappointed.,overall
Having aging parents, I was captivated by the opening of the book...The novel, the story in which the historical facts of the train circus are interwoven, appeals to any person's compassionate emotions...I really enjoyed the book, even beyond my expectations.,overall
This is wonderful book!  Ever curious about what happens behind the scenes of a circus?  Well this story shows that it's nothing like you've ever imagined.  Jacob Jankowski is en route to become a veternarian when all of a sudden he loses his parents and everything changes.  He decides to run away and runs into a traveling circus.  He eventually gets a job with them as their \vet\, and gets an inside look on the running of the circus.  But wait, now Jacob is a 90... or is it 93 year old man living in a dull nursing home.  The way that this novel flashes back and forth between the present old man and the past young Jacob as his story with the circus and the excentric characters he meets there adds a wonderful effect to this story.  It's a must read, once you pick up the book, you won't want to put it down until the end.  You'll never believe the crazyness behind the freakshows and the secretive and passionate characters behind the facade of happiness.,overall
I absolutely loved this book.I am an Animal lover,and have very fond memories of my Grandma taking me to the Circus.However I was blown away by the beauty in this book.Sarah Gruen is a Very talented writer.I gave the book to my mom when she was done and she was blown away also.At the End of the book I had tears running down my face.True Storytelling Genius.Thank you Sarah for a Refreshing,Awesome ,touching read!,overall
Water for Elephants is an exceptional read.  The characters are well-developed and authentic, the story entertaining and enlightening, the writing and research first rate.  All in all, a tremendous read.  I can't imagine anyone who would not enjoy this book, I highly recommend.,overall
I have seen this book on the best seller list for a long time now.  I would read the reviews here on amazon, pick it up in the bookstore only to put it down again, thinking this just isn't my type of book.  A few weeks ago I was talking with a collegue about recent books we have read.  She told me she just finished Water for Elephants.  Usually we like the same sort of books, so I had to ask her what she thought, I told her I just never bought it because it seemed so not interesting.  She encouraged me to read it, she said it was wonderful.Well, she was right!  It was amazing.  It read like a true story, and I am sure the author did her research. This book really made you feel for the main character, in current time and his past with the circus. It was sad at times, but also funny and thoughtful.  I read it in less than a week and it was one of those books that although you coudn't wait to see what happened, you didn't want it to end.,overall
Loved every bit of this book. The narration is well-planned...we follow Jacob Jankowsi, a would-be vet with his father until his parents are killed in a car crash. Jacob hits the road, and one night jumps on a train. Little does he know that that one jump will change his life forever--for the better and the worst.Gruen delights readers with circus life during the depression, with strong character development and a strong plot. You root for the animals, who are heinously mistreated by the ringmaster, and you root for the workers.,overall
One of the best books I've ever read.  The writing was so beautiful and lyrical.  Great surprise ending.  I'm a voracious reader, but it's been a long time since I picked up a book and didn't set it back down until I turned the last page.  Loved the \old guy\.,overall
Water for Elephants has recently taken over the spot of my favorite book. The book flawlessly alternates between the main character's present day experience in a nursing home and his memories of his life during his early 20's. I was skeptical about the switching at first since many books that do this are usually confusing and I have to keep turning back a few pages to see what time period I'm in, but the author does this perfectly.I completely fell in love with the main character, both the 92 year old and 23 year old versions of him. As someone who works in a nursing home, his experiences were so realistic and the author captured this perfectly.The book was extremely well written and it was obvious that Gruen did her research. I found myself looking for more information about travelling circuses and downloading pictures from them, especially elephants, after reading this.,overall
I was fortunate enough to first listen to this story as an audio book. If you get the chance, I'd recommend you hear the audio book as hearing the main character in the voice of a young man and as an elderly male, added to the pleasure of discovering this circus love story. Because I was so impressed by the audio book i purchased the eBook so I could enjoy it all again on my Kindle. This one is a classic, in my opinion.,overall
I have never read a book remotley like this. It has everything that I do not read. But I got curious cause everyone kept talking about it. Glad I did. It pulled me in from the first click. I grew to love everything about this book. Felt anger at the injustice. Cried at the joy. If you are curious if something so diffrent can draw you in. Don't be. This one is a keeper that I will read SEVERAL times. And always find something new.,overall
The Benzini Brothers were a third rate circus during the bottom of the Great Depression. As 90 year old Jacob now remembers it, the circus transformed the life of Marlena and himself through the power of love and trust in this heartrending story of freaks, clowns, pain and passion.  Sure to be a selection for bookclubs everywhere,overall
I'm pretty sure that no matter what I say I about this book, my words won't be able to do it justice.  It's an incredible book; brilliant, educational [to an extent] and highly entertaining.  By page ten I was hopelessly lost in its story, and fought sleep to stay awake and finish it.The story is told from the view point of a man named Jacob.  His viewpoint alternates between present time, where he is an elderly man in his 90's, in an assisted living facility which he despises, and also from the past perspective, as he recalls his days as part of a train circus in the 1930's.  When young Jacob's life turns upside down, he jumps a train, not realizing which particular train he jumped--and his world is changed forever.The story has a bit of everything; history, romance, animals, mental illness, corruption...its all in there, and its all in there in a way which leaves you incapable of putting the book down.  I learned a lot of things I didn't know before reading this book.  The intelligence of elephants is far higher than I ever gave them credit for.  I learned about the epidemic of \Jake Leg,\ which afflicted thousands of lower class folks in the 1930's.  Not to mention how much I learned about the inner working of the train circus industry.At the end of the story is a note from the author, which for that alone the book is worth reading.  Sara Gruen is very insightful and passionate, and I have a great deal of respect for her as a person and an author now.My words aren't doing this story any justice.  There's so much to it.  It's a complex work of historical fiction, and its one I hope you all read.,overall
Jacob Jankowski is pushing 90 and wallowing in a nursing home, abandoned by his family and surrounded by aged octogenarians who irk him with their senility. He has few pleasures in life --- an astute and friendly nurse named Rosemary and his vibrant memories. As Jacob lies in his bed, drifting in and out of sleep, lucidness and dreams, the compelling story of his experiences as a young man unfolds in Sara Gruen's mesmerizing new novel, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.The year is 1932. Jacob is 23 and just shy of getting his degree in veterinary medicine from Cornell when he learns that his parents have been killed in a horrific accident. Emotionally and monetarily stranded, unmoored and with nothing to lose, Jacob jumps a train and finds himself traveling with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Starting at the bottom rung of the strict caste system within the ranks of the Circus employees, Jacob's veterinary knowledge quickly garners him a place near the top of the hierarchy, among the company of the hot-headed ringmaster August and his beautiful wife Marlena --- the all-purpose female star of the show.He also finds himself among the company of cantankerous midgets, gloriously endowed \men's entertainers\ and a menagerie of exotic and soulful creatures. In her previous novels, Gruen has proven herself a master at depicting the uncanny and often astounding bond between humans and animals, and the scenes with Jacob and the creatures under his care are nuanced and lovely. Gruen paints each creature's persona with as much care and detail as she does for the humans, subtly illuminating the similarities and undermining the concept of human superiority. In the Depression-era setting of Jacob's tale, the survival of the humans is inextricably intertwined with that of the animals; they all live in a kind of chaotically symbiotic state where a star horse's sickness could spell bankruptcy and the chance for redemption lies in the acquisition of an elephant named Rosie.Exceptionally drawn as well is the development of a tentative bond between Jacob and Marlena. Jacob immediately is attracted to the lovely Marlena. She takes longer to reciprocate his affection, and throughout their cautious and hesitant budding romance the presence of Marlena's husband looms large and threatening. Gruen's pacing is excellent and the tension among Marlena, Jacob and August simmers and crackles before coming to a brutal and electrifying climax.The transitions back and forth in time, and the mundane events that unfold as Jacob moans and gripes through his days at the nursing home, could have been, in the hands of a less skilled writer, jarring and distracting, breaking the flow and drawing the reader out of the story. But while the crazed, dramatic and often spectacularly bizarre world of the Benzini Brothers is fascinating, as the novel progresses the reader becomes equally drawn into Jacob's present world. His disdain for his aged body and regret over the confusing array of relatives who visit him intermittently and whose names are permanently muddied in his mind is deeply poignant.Gruen spent years researching Depression-era circuses, and the breadth of her knowledge is revealed in all the tiny details that pepper Jacob's memories, but she also has a finely-tuned radar for the magic and mysteries of the human heart. The meat and madness of this novel may appear to lie in Jacob's memories of his younger self, but in her subtle exploration of Jacob as an old man, Gruen finds an equally compelling story.Readers may find themselves churning through this book at a rapid-fire pace, eager to see what lies ahead, then slowing down as they realize the pages are dwindling. WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a book that can be read and reread, recommended and handed off between friends; it begs to be discussed and mulled over. With lines of startling beauty, haunting and evocative scenes and finely-drawn characters who dance off the page, readers can dip in and out of the novel, immersing themselves in Jacob's memories. The story and its characters will haunt readers long after they have resurfaced.--- Reviewed by Jennifer Krieger,overall
From the very start, this book had me completely drawn - I felt immediate compassion for the main character, the author really made me think about what it means to become old and \useless\ in our society. I couldn't put this book down, the story unfolded at just the right pace, and the characters were very real and alive to me. After buying a few \duds\ recently (including Last Night in Twisted River- how dull and poorly written for such a supposedly acclaimed author that one was) I was so refreshed to read a book that made me lose myself in the story.There are scenes that are very hard to read as an animal lover, but the characters you are meant to identify with are good people, trying to do the right thing. I don't like circuses at all because of all the animal abuse, so I almost didn't buy this book - but glad I did!,overall
I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie and was greatly surprised that I enjoyed it so much.  It is a story filled with such sad moments but also the promise of a happy future.  It is told in a wonderful way.  I enjoyed the whole ride from beginning to end.  There was some moments when I just wanted him to leave the damn circus already but do what exactly?  or go work where?  you realize how bad the economy was and at least here he was eating every day which might not have been the case anywhere else.,overall
I decided to read this because of all the talk and was woried it would flop, I never should of worried. This is a wonderful novel full of plot and charactors that are a joy to meet. Definitly worth a read,  might even read it again.,overall
Loved this as much as I liked the Notebook-maybe more! Kept my attention the whole time.  Has some humor and an interesting circus story as well.  The romance...well you'll just have to read that for yourself!,overall
Sara Gruen's writing is hypnotic. The story is truly one of the best. It's perfect, tender, and rich. The author admirably convey the leading character's life in a full circle. The story will remain with you. I look forward on reading this novel again and again. I would very highly recommend it.,overall
I haven't been this engrossed in a book in quite some time.  I couldn't stop reading it!  The story was unique and interesting, and the characters were wonderful.  I loved the old man that narrated the story. The book spoke with great honesty about getting old. Read it, you won't be disappointed!,overall
In a story spanning seventy years,  Water for Elephants starts in depression-era America as a young veterinary student named Jacob Jankowski who runs from tragic circumstances, joins a circus, and then reflects on his memories at the end of his life while in a home for the aged. This book is rich in themes. It is a story about coming of age, circus life, elephants, love, friendships, cruelty, mental illness, dignity, life in an old folks home, and old age itself. Author Sara Gruen has created a world of vivid characters and scenes centering on a traveling circus. Life in this environment can be harsh and cruel, but it also has a glamorous side and a close-knit community in which decency sometimes prevails. The reader will feel the chill of despair and revulsion, but also the emotions that warm one's heart. So much goes on in Water for Elephants that I will not begin to describe the plot or all the characters. Everything is unforgettable and I find myself wondering what happened where the story left off because there is a lot more to tell. I doubt Gruen will write a sequel, but I will eagerly await one if she does.,overall
I found the book so interessting right from the beginning to the end. It starts outwith a death and it keeps you wondering how it all is going to end. To have an insidechance to see how circus people lived and how they cared for the animals gives you thatchance to 'run away with the circus',overall
One of the best books I have ever read. I absolutely loved it, the ending was so perfect I cried!,overall
My title for my book review is lifted from the editorial reviews, Valerie Ryan really nailed it for me.There are so many things to like about this book.  The very best thing is the firm grounding in historical fact.  This is what it was like in America during the Great Depression, this is why the travelling circus roustabouts worked and lived the way they did, because of the Depression.  They didn't always get paid but at least they ate.  Sara Gruen handles her historical data with an exceedingly light touch, she is a marvellous storyteller.  Memorable book, very engaging. I can understand why there are nearly four thousand reader reviews.,overall
Uplifting happy story.  Will leave you feeling satisfied and wanting to enjoy the life you have as much as possible.  This has a female author, but don't worry guys... it's not a chick book.  I have loaned this book to all of my good friends and they have all enjoyed it immensely as well.  Read this book.  You will not be disappointed.,overall
A captivating story about a lesser known part of American history. So unique. I couldn't put it down. A real page turner,overall
It's one of those rare books that is impossible to put down but after it's over, you feel like you learned a lot.I'm going to give away as little as possible about the storyline because I don't want to ruin anything, so I'll just give you a little background information. It is about the traveling circus back in the Great Depression Era and offers you a glimpse of a fantasy life that you'd never imagine on your own. She did tons and tons of research on circuses back then so everything is extremely realistic and she covers topics that have always interested me (like prohibition, speakeasies, and the intelligence of animals). To make the book even more relevant to readers today, she weaves the past in with the present to create a masterful story that you'll remember for years to come.A lot of times, after I finish reading a book I'll forget how it ended in just a few months... not in this case though, the ending gave me goosebumps and I'll always remember it vividly.,overall
I haven't read novels in many many years and I decided to pick this up at Target. I had no idea it was going to be a movie. I have to say it was incredibly engrossing, and so much fun to be a part of this other world of train circuses! This is a short review, others have said it better. I'll just say, don't hesitate. Just get it!,overall
Excellent reading,overall
I had planned on watching the movie first because it looked good and  I can't usually watch a movie and enjoy it if I read and enjoyed the book first and vis versa. However, the book got better reviews than the movie and I didn't want to taint my experience with the story, so I picked up the book first and I'm glad I did.We are deliver the story through Mr. Jacob Jankowsky's ninety, or ninety-three year old memory. He can't remember his age but he remembers his life with the train traveling circus in the 1930's like it was yesterday. We see the excitement of a life as a circus worker and more often then not the dangers that the job presents, especially if you start to fall for the crazy jealous circus trainer's wife.,overall
Great book! I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend to others. Different setting which makes it interesting. Check this book out. You won't regret it.,overall
I fell in love with this book several years ago. After hearing it was going to be a movie, I was VERRRRRRY excited.I re-read the book a few days before the movie came out, just to familiarize myself with the characters and events and again, for the second time fell in love with Jacob & Rosie.  I love the setting, Jacob's flashbacks and the language barrier with Rosie. Definitely worth the few dollars it costs.,overall
Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen tells the story of Jacob Jankowski, and almost-veterinarian whose life has just fallen apart. As he comes to this realization, Jacob stumbles upon the Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth circus train and hops aboard. He quickly secures his place on the show as the menagerie vet, a position that will change his life forever.Sara Gruen weaves an incredibly realistic tale that allows the reader a rare glimpse into the prohibition era circus lifestyle. The amount of tension throughout the book is always palatable. I often found myself clenching my jaw and holding my breath by the end of a chapter. August is a particularly well-developed character, frightening in the most realistic and entirely plausible way. There is a sense of impending destruction and collapse that builds with each paragraph.This tension is gracefully relieved every few chapters by visiting Jacob, age ninety (or ninety-three), in his current state as a resident at an assisted living facility. Through the telling of Jacob's present story, the reader reaches another level of understanding and can comprehend the meaning of Jacob's earlier experiences in entirely new ways. The tale would be much less satisfying without this continuation of the story, however small it may seem.An issue that must be addressed when talking about Water for Elephants is the treatment of animals. Some scenes in the book are very difficult to read, but it's worth reading through. You will fall in love with so many of the animals as though they're human, and you will be satisfied with their redemption.For me, Water for Elephants receives 5/5 stars. I consider it a \must read\ that will forever change the way you think. It's the type of story that won't soon leave your mind.,overall
Enjoyable, easy reading,  I look forward now to seeing the movie,  I loved the unexpected ending!  Well written story. Good.,overall
I have owned this book for a few months. I keep getting side tracked by other books so I did not read it. Last week so many people told me how wonderful the book was and even the movie. SO, I picked it up last night and am almost done with it. WOW!!! What a wonderful story. You can tell a lot of research went into this by the accuracy. While I know very little about circus life I do work with the elderly and that is all accurate. A lot on the lines of \The Notebook\ the way the story in told.,overall
An enchanting story, and not just because of the \Big Top Magic\ that the circus brings.  A wonderful read.,overall
I saw the movie before reading the book.. I taken enjoyed finding the similarities and the differences between the two.  I honestly can't say which I enjoyed better, but if you like one you will definitely be at least pleased with the other!,overall
I resisted this book for a long time but I'm so glad I finally picked it up. I'm very sad it's over. I can't wait to read more from Sara Gruen.,overall
Page after page this novel is filled with interesting facts, experiences and history. That it's a memoir of a patient/resident of a nursing home is a literary vehicle of genius. How remarkable to live the life of a this young man, one we can easily identify with, through this period of American history (30's, 40's) only to end up with him in a current-day nursing home, the finest of which are lonely places indeed.My wife and I just recently visited an uncle who lived in a very fine nursing home in another state and were pronounced \saints\ by the staff who said no one ever visits these people. That's why I'm haunted by the ending of this book.I've also paid more attention to stories of the intelligence of elephants, their almost human sense of justice. Perhaps I mean their more-than-human sense of justice.A wonderful book. You will be glad you read it.,overall
The archetypical American novel features a solitary protagonist undertaking an odyssey in which he/she confronts both physical and moral challenges and through which he/she emerges with a renewed spirit, transformed by the crucible of confrontations with adversaries, both real and imagined.  Sara Gruen's engaging \Water for Elephants\ is an eminently American work, set in the depths of the Depression and featuring a broken-hearted young man whose unplanned existential leap of faith catapults him into a chaotic and unknown way of life.  Jacob Jankowski discovers his untapped reservoir of courage, conviction and compassion, and in so doing, he, in every manner of the American definition of the word, emerges as a hero.  \Water for Elephants\ is a triumph  --  of a writer fully in control of her craft, of a character resolute in his determination to discover life and of a depiction of ideas that truly embody our national character.The innocent Jacob, on the threshold of graduating from Cornell veterinary school and returning to the Midwest to practice medicine with his father, is shattered by the sudden accidental deaths of his parents.  Unmoored from his past and unable to focus on his final examination, he abandons his former life the moment he jumps on board a passing train.  To his astonishment, he has leaped into the midst of a traveling circus, and, thanks to the flinty care of several roustabouts, manages to gain employment with the tawdry Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a circus dominated by a sadistic ringmaster and populated by a cast of characters, admirable and evil in equal proportions.  In a manner of weeks, Jacob immerses himself as the circus \vet,\ forms abiding friendships, falls is love and faces moral dilemmas that tie his conscience into Gordian knots.Some critics have likened Jacob to his biblical counterpart and praised the novel for its allusions to the Bible.  In my opinion, Jacob mirrors a less sanctified model, Huckleberry Finn.  Like Huck, Jacob flees familiar surroundings, flaunts social norms, befriends outcasts and risks his personal safety in order to adhere to a hard-earned sense of conscience and social responsibility.  Both Huck and Jacob confront mendacious adversaries, rejoice in life on the lam and re-invent themselves.  Like Twain, Sarah Gruen writes with inordinate respect about the dispossessed and with painful awareness about the inexplicable capacity for the human heart to do well in the midst of spiritual darkness.  As Twain has written  --  and as Gruen affirms  --  the source of humor is pain.Even the title bespeaks our capacity for misrepresentation.  The elderly Jacob, shunted away by his family in a assisted-living nursing home, excoriates a new resident who has claimed to have carried water in buckets for elephants when he was a youngster.  Aware of an elephant's enormous drinking capacity, Jacob knows a lie when he hears one.  And well he should.  The entire purpose of the traveling circus is deception, an enterprise where rubes are separated from their money by gaping at mangy animals, staring at sideshow freaks (many of whom are frauds) or being serviced by \exotic dancers.\  Falsehoods, illusions and duplicity are the moral big tent under which circus performers enchant Depression men and women hungry for escape.  The central conflict of the novel rotates around Jacob's involvement with a married woman and the peculiarly disturbing aspects of her husband's mental state.  This conflict is rife with secrecy, duplicity and tormented twisting of ideas of right and wrong.It is no surprise that this novel is a best-seller.  Written with extraordinary narrative drive, populated by characters who truly represent our national character and animated by a young man whose journey for self-discovery is our own, \Water for Elephants\ intimately involves us in Jacob Jankowski's search for meaning.,overall
Water for Elephants offers some thing for everyone.  If you're a pragmatist you will love the research and facts concerning the circus of the depression era.  If a romantic, the ending will be for you. If you are young, the choices and frustrations suffered by Jacob will be yours. For me, a senior citizen, the gerentology  added greatly to the story.I thought it a great read especially since there are 70 years between the youth and aged of the story which is told in flashback form. There is little in common between the two periods of time except for love and the anticipation of all ages.Try it, you will like it.,overall
Amazing book which brings us into the life of a student at Cornell whose life changes dramatically and rapidly within a few days - and, as with all persons, those dramatic changes influence the rest of his life.  The story is of a circus worker during the depression...and it brought back some vague memories of my early childhood, watching a small circus roll into town, watching the elephants parade through from the train depot and to a farmer's field where the \Big Top\ would suddenly sprout with flags a-flying.  The story is told from the view of the worker who's now in his 90's...and is fascinating as to how the author mixes past and present to give a picture of an amazing whole.,overall
This is the type of book where you're reading and forget about the rest of the world. I felt like Alice in Wonderland, lost in another world (1930s) with colorful characters (a circus). Yes, this book is about a circus and, yes, YOU WILL LOVE IT! Definitely a \re-readable\ book!,overall
I really did not know what to expect when I picked up this book, but I am so glad that I did. It was a great story with wonderful life-like characters. In parts it is funny and sad and also shocking when you read how some of the circus workers and animals were treated. I really hated to see it end. Do yourself a favor and read it, you won't be sorry.,overall
I honestly didn't know what to expect when I started WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, but as I continued on hour after hour, I realized what a terrific book it is!  Set in post-Depression America and the Benzini Brother's Circus, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is full of emotions and flashes of great humor. All the characters, including the animals, all have pivotal roles throughout the story. This book is a great blend of history, mystery, love story and memoir.Highly recommend with 5 stars!!!,overall
WATER FOR ELEPHANTS IS A RIVETING READ REVEALING THE UGLY UNDERSIDE OF DPRESSION ERA 'TRAIN CIRCUSES.  ALONG WITH ACCOUNTS OF CRUELTY TO MAN AND BEAST ARE STORIES OF GENEROSITY AND KINDNESS.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK, ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE TOO DISTURBING FOR SOME. I STARTED READING WITH MY GLASSES, THEN GLASSES AND A MAGNIFYING GLASS AND FINALLY WITH DOUBLE VISION BECAUSE I  COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.,overall
Weird but still very interesting... I enjoyed this book very much.. It had a very happy ending..I wanted to finish the book as soon as I opened it,overall
This is one of the most fun books I have read.  From page 1 all the way thru. I have laughed out loud at so many points and then sad at others. This is a fantastic read. I usually don't like to read women authors, Tess Gerritson and Alex Kava are the exceptions, but Sara has done a great, great job. I can hardly wait now to see the movie. I hope Sara had a lot to do with writing the movie script.  So many really good books stories are ruined when it comes to be a movie.,overall
In the beginning of Water For Elephants Jacob Jankowski tells us that he is 90 or 93 (who can really be certain anymore?) His body betrayed him years ago and Jacob now fears that his mind isn't far behind. Shuffling along miserably behind his walker, he's living out his final days in the nursing home and hating every minute of it. Just another invisible senior citizen who's family and the world as a whole has forgotten about.When the circus comes to town and sets up its Big Top tents across the street Jacob comes alive and through a series of flashbacks begins to tell us his life's story. Taking us back to when he joined the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show On Earth, a traveling circus he toured with during the great depression.At the age of 23 Jacob had a predictable future set out ahead of him, one that certainly didn't involve joining the circus. However with his parents untimely death and the bank foreclosing on his family home Jacob soon finds himself homeless, heartbroken and mentally quite unable to sit his final veterinary exams. When an exotic, animal filled train steams toward him Jacob doesn't even think. Flinging himself aboard the boxcar and inadvertently changing his destiny forever.I absolutely adored this book, alternately falling in love with both Jacob, the crotchety old man and Jacob, the young, moral and penniless circus veterinarian. Water For Elephants transported me to another time and quickly became one of those books I never wanted to end.Author Sara Gruen has researched the depression era circus life down to the smallest of details and I feel that this captivating and vivid story will appeal to almost anyone.Filled with action, adventure and a sweet forbidden romance there is also a fascinating sideshow of secondary characters including a clever Polish Elephant, a grouchy little person as Jacob's roommate and a cruel and schizophrenic animal trainer whose wife Jacob just happens to fall in love with. All of this has been wrapped together with a compelling and innovative behind the scenes look aboard a travelling circus train. Showing us more often then not the darker side of circus life after the big top closes down. This is a love story, a life story, an animal lover's story but above all it's a circus story and who of us hasn't dreamed about running away and joining the circus at some point in our lives? And the ending... *sigh*I can't say enough good about this book, its easily one of my favourite reads this year and with Robert Pattison now taking on the upcoming movie role version of Jacob, I was able to picture him while reading, making it all the more sweeter.,overall
Water For Elephants is one of the best books I have read this year. Initially, I did not have any interest in reading this book because it involved a circus and I am not a huge fan of circuses. But at the insistence of some friends, I picked it up and began reading. Boy am I glad I did!Jacob Jankowski is a young man who is thrust mercilessly into the aftermath of the cruelties of life. Despite his circumstances, however, he is a good and honorable man and his compassion and honor shine through on every page of this book. He is a character that reader's immediately fall in love with and can relate to on some level or another. The story itself grabs you instantly and takes you back to a time where traveling circuses were the biggest events in town.Set in the 1930's, Water For Elephants offers a glimpse into a very strange and wonderous world of circus folk during a time when many, if not most, of the country was unemployed and doing anything they could to earn a buck or at least a meal. It was fascinating to read of the lifestyle of the circus workers and how they were treated, how they related to one another, how they treated their animals and what they thought of the townspeople they traveled the country to entertain.Water For Elephants is also a story that tells of the love and life of Jacob and Merlena and their love for the animals that they come to know while working with them in the circus. The book is beautifully and vividly written, the characters well developed and easy to love (or hate as the case may be) and the animals' antics, especially Rosie, will make you laugh out loud.Water For Elephants is a wonderful read and I highly recommend it!,overall
Since it was/has been made into a movie.  And as usual the book is always better than the movie.  But the movie does follow the book pretty well.  You just don't get the back story on everything that you do by reading the book.,overall
I know that not one book is for everyone, but I honestly cannot imagine someone not loving Water For Elephants. I didn't go into it expecting to fall in love, but that's exactly what I did. The story, told through an elderly and retirement-home bound Jacob Jankowski, takes us on a journey as he recalls life on the circus. Hopping on a train, Jacob is looking for an escape from life at home where he has lost everything dear to him. He discovers that the old train is carting a circus show, and eventually gets himself a job. Along the way he falls in love with the majestic circus act, the amazing animals, and of course, the young and beautiful Marlena.I was repeatedly impressed by the great and believable depth of the characters in this book, including Marlena's ill-tempered and abusive husband, August. Jacob,the main character, stays strong and consistent throughout the entire story. I liked how he came to the rescue of all in need and didn't back down when the going got tough. His heroic acts and the fantastic tale that go along with it make this a five-star read in my book!,overall
Water for Elephants, by Sara Gruen, is a pleasurable book to read.  Among its many virtues, is Guren's recreation of the atmosphere of depression era America, and a unique circus subculture that existed in what now must be viewed as the lost past.  Leading this tale is a genuinely likeable guy, a rarity in contemporary literature.  This hugely popular book is without serious lessons to preach or meaning to convey.  Rather, it is a good story which provided me with many hours of pleasant diversion.,overall
I found this book to be a very touching story with an interesting setting. The time period, the place, and the characters come to life in this wonderful story.  I don't want to give too much away but if you enjoy a book that makes you feel as though you are there...this is one!  There were times while reading this I wanted to throw a few punches, and other times I wanted to stand between August & Rosie, and times I just wanted to pat the hand of the older Jacob.  I'm sorry I finished this book...I will miss these characters.,overall
This was an unexpectly good book.  There are really two stories in it and I enjoyed both completely.  I loved the end.,overall
I had heard alot about this book before reading it and read so many positve comments and reviews but tried to go into it with an open mind so I could decide for myself! I was not disappointed, it was a terrific book, so well written, full of rich history. It was difficult to put down!,overall
I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this book but was quickly drawn into the storyline.  As the daughter of an aging parent, I could empathize with the main character.  The story was developed well even with the flipping from the past to the current time.  At times I had a hard time putting the book down.  I had not seen the movie (but I will download it now) so the ending was a real surprise to me.  I enjoyed it immensely.,overall
I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end!  I now have a new respect for Circus people and animals.  I couldn't put the book down.,overall
I read this book not too long after it came out, I had borrowed it then and decided it was so good to go ahead and buy a copy for myself. I love it!! It was full of emotion and excitement. Sara Gruen is an excellent author.I just bought her other book Ape House and I can't wait to get into it,overall
I really enjoyed this book!  I enjoyed the imagery of the circus and the settings, the historical facts of both the Great Depression and circuses during that time period, and I enjoyed learning more about circuses and the treatment of circus animals overall!There were parts that were disturbing - the mistreatment of circus animals, the mistreatment of circus employees, and the abuse of the lead woman.  But, overall, the plot was engaging and unique.  I especially enjoyed the flashback moments of the present lead character and his reminiscence of the past.  Make sure to read the Prologue! - it adds to the artistic nature of the writing style.I haven't seen the movie yet - hope it's as good as the book.,overall
A great story from beginning to end. The information about life working for the \Big Top\ is entertaining and absorbing. Drama, excitement, hardship, and a love story make this an excellent read.,overall
This book is very enjoyable from beginning to end. It starts with a narration in the present and weaves in events from the narrators past. The style is fluid and non pretentious, engaging for its simplicity and character development. This book feels real when it presents its characters and you can't help but get entwined with the sentiments they live. I haven't seen the movie but I'm glad I read the book first. The story revolves around Jakob a retired circus vet which relates how he came to be involved in the circus world of the 30's and all he lived through while the show went on. The story depicts life through the depression, prohibition and society as a fitting background for the storyline.,overall
Wow.  This book was just spectacular.  I tore through it (it grabbed me and would not let go).  How many books do you see a fifteen-year-old (my niece) reading while walking up stairs?  She could not stop reading it to climb the stairs!  It was an amazing ride.  I cannot imagine that ANYONE would not love this book.I read two of Sara Gruen's earlier books and this is in a different category - a tour de force, an absolute must-read.  What a lovely book.  You end up feeling grateful to her for writing it just so you could read it.  I cannot say enough about how great this book was - an enthralling story, enthrallingly told, absolutely marvelous.,overall
I liked the story because it was different than other books I have read. The setting, characters, and plot were unique and very interesting. I liked how the story was told from both the older and younger Jacob's point of view.,overall
One of the best books I read in 2007.  Sara Gruen is a great storyteller.,overall
The plot is uncomplicated, the characters are not memorable, but the setting is the key!  Depression literature has been depressing.  However, the story about how real people handled it in an unusual setting is delightful.  In addition, the details about the circus are enlightening.,overall
When Jacob Jankowski's parents died in an automobile accident, he was just about to become a Veterinarian.But, with that shock, and the shock of finding out that his parents didn't leave him the financial comforts that he had thought were there, Jacob, didn't take his last college exam.  And, he wondered into the life of a circus, where he learned a great deal about the human condition and about animals.During these tough Depression Era days, he lived in filth, but the animals meant a great deal to him.  So, he applied what he had learned at Cornell University Veterinarian School, to protect the animals, and anyone who he loved.This book was a story about love, loss and finding what matters most to you, when you've loss what seemed to be all that mattered.,overall
BOOK IS BOTH OF HISTORICAL VALUE AND WONDERFUL LOVE STORY ALONG WITH GREAT PORTRAYAL OF INVISIBILITY OF OLD AGE THROWN IN.,overall
Well, I spent 30 minutes writing a thorough review for one of the best books I've read in a long time, and--it's been three days--and it's not showing up.  I can't recreate what took so long to write, so I'll just say...this book is woooonderful.  I hated for it to end.,overall
This is a wonderful book.  Beautifully written and thoroughly engrossing.  An absolute pleasure.  Highly and enthusiastically recommended.,overall
I still haven't watched the movie and don't intend to. The book was amazing and I read it in about 2 days because I just couldn't put it down!,overall
A wonderful story!  If nothing else this is an insight into the aging process.  As a child growing up in the 40's my dad took me to  watch the set up of Ringling Brother's Circus when it came to town and we went back that night to watch the teardown.  I never saw a show until I was 12 years old and worked watering horses for my pass into the show.  I remember getting to hold a very small tiger cub that had been recently born.  It was a thrill I will never forget.  So very glad that a friend told me to read &#34;Water for Elephants&#34;.  I am sure that I will reread it again in the future.  Buy it!  You won't be sorry if you remember the circus coming to town!,overall
Wonderful book.  It kept my attention through the entire book.  I did wish there had been more on their life together later.,overall
Water for Elephants is a compelling story told from the memory of a ninety-one (or ninety-three)year-old man named Jacob Jankowski. The story begins as Jacob prepares to sit for his veterinary exams at Cornell University. He receives word that his parents have been killed in a car accident and things go downhill from there. He ends up as part of a circus and the next three-and-a-half months are mostly a living hell, except for Marlena.The story goes back and forth between the present time in the \assisted-living\ home where Jacob resides and his memories of the past. His children/grandchildren/great grandchildren take turns visiting him, but first-born son, Simon, misses the most important day of all. In the end, this misstep creates for Jacob, and the reader, a most satisfying end to a moving and heartwarming life story. (A bonus in this book is what the reader learns about circus life in the early part of the 20th century, most of which is pretty nasty.)As I care for my aged mother in her home, I am very grateful that we have been able to keep her here. This book provides a perspective from the viewpoint of the very elderly, who, while not as quick on all fronts as they once were, are still thinking, feeling beings.Carolyn Rowe Hill,overall
This book provided a vivid illustration.  I could see the story playing in my head.  I recommend this book as a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon,overall
LOVED this book. It is now one of my all time favorites. A must read for anyone. Has romance, animals, and a thriller. Has a little of everythimg for anyone. Have already recommended it to people.,overall
Water for Elephants entertains and enlightens the reader with vibrant characters that jump from the page. They paint a picture of life in the circus in the late 1930's;  sometimes grand and often tragic.,overall
I lent it to my mother and bought this paper back version for my daughter. She shared it with all her friends.  Much different story than the movie.,overall
Cannot say enough about this book, so all I will say is I could not put it down and never wanted it to end.,overall
What an amazing story!  Such interesting details about circus life...scary and gripping, and funny and sweet all at once.  The characters were so carefully drawn that I really felt for them and wanted to know even more about them.  I  was beguiled and spellbound to the very end.,overall
heard about this book from a friend and was unable to put it down! as a healthcare worker, the character of older jacob has insights all should be aware of and consider. vivid imagery and a fascinating plot. highly reccomended,overall
I couldn't put this book down. I have seen the awards it won, but never thought about getting it, I wondered who this Sara Gruen is, never read her books. SO I didn't go out of my way to pick it up. Somebody brought it in to work. We have a bookshelf full of books that we share. I saw it and thought, OK, now I am going to read that, it is here, I keep seeing it, I am taking the plunge!How wonderful. I was completely and totally into the book after reading the first 4-5 pages. I couldn't put it down. I loved it, this isn't my type of book normally. However, it is a great read. I felt like I was standing next to the big top through the whole book. Get it, read it and enjoy it, that is the purpose of this book.,overall
I loved this book it wasn't something I would have normally read. I was given this book by a friend and I was amazed that I got so into it.,overall
** spoiler alert ** Before I picked this much talked about book, particularly since the film came out, I heard from a few friends that they couldn't read it because of the animal abuse. When I thought that's what the book was about, I actually didn't want to read it either not because I care so much but because I'm not quite as impassioned on the topic. It's not that I'm heartless or ignorant of that. It's just that I don't need to read anything about that topic to make me \feel\ the injustice. But, with the hype and since I love to compare books to film, I figured I had to read it before I saw the film with Edward...ahem I mean Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon. So, I did and immediately I was drawn in. I enjoyed how the narrative sliced between present day retirement home and past circus life. I appreciated the difficulties and heartaches of dealing with old age and time passing, with loneliness and loss of certain freedoms, with death. Of course, I also loved how the two main characters grew, fell in love, and fought against the obstacles to be together.It actually reminded me of Sparks' The Notebook. So, if you liked that and you like the circus, this is definitely the read for you. And for those animal rights activists, I didn't find the scenes of animal abuse that offensive. That topic is definitely a character in the book and certainly touched upon vividly BUT it's not accepted as just fact. It's shown for just what it is...horrendous...and that seems to make it more palatable. So, I would encourage the read anyway.,overall
Take a chance and read this book.  It is wonderfully written.  Such an interesting book to take the lead character and having him in a nursing home, thinking of his life... and what a great life.  What a heart warming story.  I'm fascinated by the freakish carnivale life, and this didn't disappoint (but uphold) that theory!  If you're in for an uplifting tale of struggle and happiness in an unexpected way, you've found the perfect all-around book.  Enjoy!,overall
I loved this book. I'd been hearing so much about it prior to the film that I decided I had to read it. No one had really told me what the book was about so I was more than pleasantly surprised at the subject matter. I have always had an interest in the Great Depression and riding the Circus Train during that time period with Jacob was one of the best trips of my life. Sara Gruen's writing is descriptive and made me feel like I was actually involved in the lives of her characters. It was an easy read but a cause for dismay when it ended. I wanted it to go on and on. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who just enjoys a good story.,overall
What a terrific read......It also intrigued me to learn more about the history of the circus and possible trip to a circus museum in Florida.......There should definitely be a movie on this book.......recommend it!,overall
This is one book I didn't want to end! I read it in one day, just can't put it down! Eventhough the scenes go back and forth between the circus and the nursing home, Sara Gruen made the scenes flow almost seamlessly. It made me wish that I was there in the circus. The scenes in the nursing home made me want to go to one and just hug the elederly residents there. This book is definitely the BEST!!!!!,overall
Water for elephants is one of the best books l,'ve read in sometime.Hard to quit reading once you start.highly recommended for all adults.,overall
Frankly, all of the good things have been said about this book by other reviewers. I can only thank Public Radio that had a review of it. Otherwise I would not have heard of it.One of the things that the book points out is how tough life was during the depression.  American today have no concept of what it was like for people who earned no money, had no money, and had no place to go. There were no homeless shelters, no social security.  It was a different world.Gruen does a great job of showing the read the America of the Depression years and also tells a wonderful story.,overall
This book is easy to get into, and once you're there, you won't want put the book down.  The author's use of imagery paints the scenes so well, with a believable but unusual assortment of characters.  It entertains and engrosses you with turns and twists in the story line.  I loved it!,overall
A story that reminds you that it is never to late to have an adventure.Don't pick it up .... unitl you are prepared to read it from cover to cover- becasue once you start you wount want to put it down.I am eargerly awaiting the film version.,overall
The author alternates the time period and venue between chapters. It's a fascinating story and even more amazing considering the author is a woman and the protagonist is a 90-year-old man.,overall
When I picked up this book, I was not sure what to expect. The first few pages hooked me and it was all I could do not to put the book down til the very last page. I spent a season with the blue unit of Ringling Brothers back in the 80s and even though the life has changed a great deal from the circus trains during the depression, the lifesytle is quite similiar. The different cliques, the constant travel schedule and life on the road. I remember many a nights sitting with other \joeys\ and talking with the oldtimers who told similiar tales as in Water for Elephants.  My thanks to Sara for bringing back some great memories of my own circus career and putting a great story to such a facinating and unknown part of history for many people.  I do wish she had gone a little deeper into some of the other acts and aspects of circus life, but maybe there is another novel about life on the Ringling circuit. Loved the ending - so appropriate. Have recommended this book to all my friends and if you are looking for a thriling, dramatic read, this book is for you. Does not matter if you are not into circus life, this is so much more. It is about living, learning, trying to be the best you can be and never giving up. 5 stars - would give it more, but 5 is all that Amazon allows. Those who give this book 1 and 2 stars have no idea what they are talking about - have you read the book?,overall
I'm usually drawn to books written about the depression era, as I have heard so much about it from my parents.  This book is not only that, but a great insight to the circus life during that time.  I had a hard time putting this book down in the evenings (after a day at work), and it was good timing that my spouse was out of town for the week.  Very well written, a great story, and a page turner. I'll be buying copies for future gifts.,overall
This is definately one of the best books I read all year. I fell in love with the characters and the story. I couldn't put it down.,overall
Loved this book.  It portrays the life of survival of humans and animals alike.  It has always amazed me how elephants put up with us ignorant humans and our slow mentality in catching on as to how to treat them according to their abilities. The fact that elephants haven't done away with all evil handlers is a testament to the amazing personality, patience and attitude of their creation. The circus realm has a lot of shame, guilt and blame placed at its feet. Even though this is a fictional story, the real stories of circus elephants is much worse and a hard read.  I'm looking forward to another place in time where all will live in peace with all living things as this great earth was intended.,overall
This book kept me up past midnight this morning; it was the selection for our book discussion group this afternoon.  Each person in our group rated it a 5, which generally means the book was so good we couldn't put it down.I qualified my vote by saying I would give it a 5 for the author's work in researching her material and in linking Jacob's 90 or 93-year old self to his younger self along with her use of dreams and/or daydreams.The book was a page-turner as another member of our group had told me.  It arrived from amazon.com on Tuesday after I finally decided to pay full price for it since I was not finding a really good buy for a used copy elsewhere online.I am generally a slow reader, wanting to picture each event in my mind before I continue.  However, the book went pretty fast since it has a lot of dialog.One thing our book discussion group questioned.  How could Jacob be so sure that Mr. McGuinty could not have carried water for the elephants?  Couldn't he have been one of a number of boys who carried buckets of water to the elephants?  The author did not explain this.We saw some similarities to the Jacob in the Bible, but perhaps we missed some which the author included.  My Bible tells me that the name Jacob means \deceiver\ so in what way were we deceived by him?  Were the last two chapters factual, or were they daydreams which came to Jacob as he sat in his wheelchair?,overall
Water for Elephants is one of my all-time favorite books.  I read it in one sitting on a plane and then on an airport bus.  I was captivated the whole time.  I enjoyed it so much that I later checked out the audio version from the library and enjoyed it just as much, if not more.  Definitely worth a read for anyone who likes elephants, circuses, veterinarians, period fiction (Depression Era), or just good books in general.,overall
I'm so glad I finally got around to reading this book. I purchased it a while ago, thinking it was going to be the next read in my book club. That didn't happen and I actually forgot I had it on my Kindle.Truth be told, I waffled between 4 and 5 stars. Here's why...**Spoilers**Although flashing back between old Jacob and young Jacob ended up necessary for the reader to get the whole story, it was a bit annoying to me at first. Well, really, for most of the book. It wasn't that I didn't enjoy the old Jacob parts, they were very well written. The young Jacob parts were so well written, the change from one perspective to the other often threw me out of the story. I would be reading along, really into the story. Bam! Now we're back in the nursing home. It really distracted me. I even noted, about the third time this happened, that there better be a reason for the back and forth or I would look at it as a crutch the author felt she had to use. I still don't feel it was totally necessary to have old Jacob, but it was nice to have the closure that point of view was able to give us.Regardless, I will be recommending this book to all the readers I know. Not so much for the romance, to me that was a side story, but for the relationships Jacob had with the rest of the characters.,overall
Loved this book.  A true to life story and unique because it is about a man's life in his words. Easily read and comfortable transition between past and present.  Great unexpected ending.,overall
Though I am an avid reader and read hundreds of books a year, this is the first time I have felt the need to review a fiction book for Amazon.  There are very few books that I read that I will always remember or possibly even read again but this is one of them.  I read and enjoyed Gruen's other two books \Riding Lessons\ and \Flying Changes\ but was overwhelmed by \Water for Elephants\.  I liked the fact that the past is being recalled by a 90 (possibly 93) year old man - you don't find many books that have an elderly protaganist and it was refreshing.  I enjoyed the many animals in the story - Rosie and Bobo especially.  I enjoyed learning about the traveling circuses and felt that Gruen really did do a wonderful job researching this book (I think the old circus photos added a nice touch, too).  The story fit together seamlessly and I was disappointed when it ended - I would have liked to read about the married years in more depth.  The ending surprised and delighted me. This was a great \feel good\ book.,overall
I was captivated by this book. The bits of historical data mixed with fiction made the story seem more authentic.The tale is told by a 93-year-old man in a nursing home. His recollections lend to the authenticity of this story. At first, it seemed like this had been a real relative of the author. When I realized that it was not, I was amazed with the author's creativity.,overall
This book was absolutely wonderful!  Sara Gruen is an amazing writer and the story is wonderful.  I could hardly put it down once I started and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great read.,overall
It's the early 1920s. Jacob Jankowski is about to finish up his veterinary degree at Cornell University when he learns that his parents have been killed in a car crash. Stunned by this awful and sudden turn of events, Jacob completely blanks while taking his final exams. He walks out and wanders out of town in a complete daze, eventually jumping a train. It turns out he has jumped the circus train for the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.Jacob pretty much instantly falls for Marlena, one of the star performers. The only problem is that she is already married to August, the animal manager, who is, as we come to find out, a paranoid schizophrenic with erratic behavior problems. The story focuses on these three characters as the circus train makes its way around the country, performing in various cities. Along the way, the circus acquires an elephant, Jacob befriends his reluctant roommate, and tries to save an ailing friend from being tossed from the circus.This is a really interesting and moving book. It's really fascinating to read about daily circus life and how things worked. And it's a touching story about a smart elephant, a compassionate vet, and a forbidden love. I do wish there had been some more charater development for Rosie the elephant, though. Also, the story is told in retrospect, from a present-day Jacob who is now in his 90s. Every few chapters, the story skips back to present day, and the nursing home-bound narrator. I felt the story would have worked a lot better if it had just stuck to the circus part of the story. The present day interjections were distracting. Other than that, this was an excellent book. Highly recommended.,overall
Not everyone loves this book but I did!  It was my first novel read on my new Kindle Paper White!,overall
I finished this book a few weeks ago and I still am thinking about it. The characters are all unique and the animals as well. Life was hard  in those times people  had to survive.,overall
I loved this book - there are a few naysayers in the sea of positive reviews and there is a reason for this.  It is an excellent book - of course it is not air tight but it is a fun read and interesting.  It reminded me in some way of the White City book in that it took history, in this case of the circus in a certain time period in history, and wove a story around this history.  It took me a little less then two days to read it and well worth the story!ooking for a fun fast read with a great story line - buy and enjoy this book!,overall
Love this book! The story was so interesting and kept you wanting more! I learned about circus life all while enjoying a great story.,overall
I enjoyed the story and it definitely kept my interest. I kept wanting to see what would happened next, so I finished it in just a couple days.,overall
What a great story! Now I'm sure we'll go see the movie.  The author did an excellent job with the plot and her research for details was awesome. Very good portrayal of the time period. Loved the ending, I work in a nursing home and could really feel for the main character - don't want to spoil it for anyone but it was the perfect way to finish! I've read it twice and also listened to the audio!,overall
I loved how this story switched between the past and the present.  I haven't read a book like that in awhile, so I was really happy for something different...a little break from the norm.  I couldn't put this book down, and now heard it is being made into a movie.  Woo hoo!,overall
This book surprised me by how moving and beautiful it is contrasted by the dark and ugly of circus life.I really wasn't sure I would like it, but again my book club chose to read it. A character driven story that gives insight into a lifestyle most never think about.,overall
Fell in love with the characters!  Although I didn't research the story, it felt very real & could possibly be historically correct about circus'.  This was a page turner... real almost in one sitting.  Now I need to see the movie!,overall
This is a great book and is so much more enjoyable than the movie. The writing style is in depth and concise a great read!,overall
I listened to the audio CD, which is narrated by one voice for the older Jacob and one for the younger Jacob.  The reading is superb, and the story is unusual, but terrific.  I listened to it twice before I donated it to the local senior commmunity, where they had chosen it for their monthly book club.  I highly recommend it, particularly for an experience 'off the beaten path.',overall
I read a lot of books and save my reviews for the ones that I really love - this story was wonderful. I literally read it from start to finish in one sitting. Jacob's story is amazing. A must read. Really don't know what more to say except that you should read this book.,overall
While I am not a circus fan, this book takes the reader back to a tragic time in the late 20's and early 30's to \witness\ the life of the people living the life of the train circus exsistence. I admire the author's work to provide the research to make this story not only horrifying at times, but also has an interest in this era of our history. There were many times I felt that it was difficult to put it down - definitely worth reading...,overall
The book came super fast, packaged perfectly and in perfect condition. Everything I'd expeced it to be. Could hardly believe the speed in which I received it.,overall
I never write reviews... but for this book I felt the need to! The book was just plain wonderful! I fell in love with Jacob both old and young! I got it for my Kindle but i am going to have to by the DTB as well! love this book!!!!! There is no way to really sum this book up, other then wonderful!,overall
A quick read with wonderful detail. The characters really come to life on the pages of this book.  I really enjoyed the way the story moves back and forth between young and old Jacob.,overall
I really enjoyed reading this book. I saw the movie first, then decided to read it. It's pretty different from the movie but I like that. It's story was great, really made you love Jacob. Must read!,overall
I almost bought this book 2 years ago while on vacation. Thought I had too many books in my arms, so I put it down! Wow, what a mistake! I just read it on my kindle and LOVED it. I fell in love with Jacob with the first line. Wonderful book, now I have to check into some more of Sara Gruen's books!,overall
This book is well done.  Written in the style of a \life review\, it is a look back on the life of a circus, and the characters that made it work.  I was suprised at how well I enjoyed it, and the development of the characters.  The reality of the life style that the carnies lived and  the social prejudcies involved.  This is a worth your time.,overall
I don't know why I picked up this book to read, but I'm glad I did!  All summer, I've become bored with other books I've attempted to read but abandoned half way through.Water for Elephants was different.  Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down.  The author did a great job developing the characters and the story.  I didn't know much about circus life and the story gives the reader a good glimpse of what it was like.  Because I'm an animal lover, I liked how the main character looked out for well being of the circus animals.I recommend this book.,overall
The Author weaves an exciting and enduring tale that brings to life an American era. The juxtaposition of the glamorous and gritty circus set in the Depression mirrors the wonderful and grim love story. Each sentence is thoughtfully written, pulling the reader in. Loved it.,overall
So far there are 866 reviews for this book, so there's nothing I can say that's different from anyone else.  It got to be so absorbing by the middle of the book with a VERY satisfying ending.  I couldn't resist adding another review to thank Sara Gruen for this wonderful story.  I just finished it a minute ago...I ignored my kids all night while caught up in this story.  Now my kids can have me back!  Please read and enjoy this book.  Thank you.,overall
This is one of the best books that I have ever read. I am not a book enthusiast, however this one has grabbed me from the first page and I have had a hard time putting it down. What a dramatic story that is so wonderfully written.If you are wondering if you should get this book or not, do it! You will not be disappointed!!!,overall
An excellent read.  Even though it didn't sound like something I would read, it kept me reading.  I couldn't put it down.,overall
Im usually skepical when it comes to reading a book that has become a movie . I end up either loving the movie and not liking the book or loving the book and not liking the movie. THIS book was stunning in detail and takes the reader into the 'Big Top' in such detail that you can almost smell the peanuts! It contains violence but it is told with such skill that the reader understands just how brutal humans can be ....but the main character is the hero and does make a difference . As for the romance...its innocent and well written. There is something for all in this story and I see now why it was made into a movie. I have not seen it yet but I can only imagine !,overall
This novel is a wonderful mix of fantasy and reality, pathos and joy!  With the sad tale of Jacob unfolding in the first chapter, the reader is quickly engaged in the story.  The inter-chapters weave the tale from the past into the present and make the reader empathize with Jacob and become endeared to the Circus and its workers.I read chapter 5 to my high school senior English class to give them insight into the life of an old man and his perspective on reminiscence and life.  They loved it!  They even gained new perspective on the elderly that they work with at their community service sites.What a good book!  I recommend it to all ages.  It is fun and full of humanity.,overall
This book was made into a good movie a couple of years ago.  I always recommend that you read the book before seeing the film and again, this is the case.  This is an intricate, dramatic love story, with twists that hold your attention.  An excellent read.,overall
Who would ever guess that a story about a circus would be so fantastic? The author, Sara Gruen, knew that's who.  Well, she was right. Jacob is lost after the death of his parents.  When he is just a final exam away from his veterinary license he stumbles upon a traveling circus train and inadvertently joins.  Through Jacob we get a glimpse behind the scenes of the the characters, relationships, struggles, and class warfare of circus folk.  Intertwined in this interesting story of the circus is a love story.  I noticed that one of the other reviewers found the love story a bit trite, but I disagree.  I found the love story completely believable and the use of flashback extremely effective.  Most importantly, I must tell you, I cried.  I RARELY cry while reading.  You are are going to dig this book!,overall
Passion, hatred, love, and murder; Water for Elephants, the novel by Sara Gruen has it all. It's rare that I read a novel and become so engulfed with the story, but from the first page, I was hooked. The way in which Gruen has the protagonist of the story, Jacob Jankowski, switch back and forth between his 22-year-old self and present day 90 (or 93) year-old self is both creative and effective in capturing her readers. Every single scene has intensity and vibrancy. The juxtaposition of the elderly Jankowski and the young circus worker Jankowski posed a humorous yet almost sad setting for the story. Readers would be crazy not to fall in love with his character.Though fiction, the novel represents the lives of circus workers back in the 1920's and 1930's and gives insight to the gruesome conditions the men had to live in, and the constant struggles that they faced everyday. Each chapter begins with a photograph derived from circuses back from the time Jankowski would have worked. The photos truly show the lives that these men led and let readers see not only imagine how things were. Though the historical value of the novel was fascinating, the forbidden but passionate relationship between Marlena and Jacob was the most captivating portion. The constant secrecy from August and the fear of being revealed created an incredible emotional reaction for me.The corruption of the novel and the intensity of the characters made this novel a hard one to dislike. In my opinion, it has to be one of the best books written in the past few years. If there were one book I had to recommend to anyone, it would definitely have to be Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen.,overall
a friend lent this book to me and i really enjoyed it a lot. the writing is nice and clear and switches between current day where jacob is in a nursing home and back then in the 1930s when he works for a circus. most of the story happens at the circus and tells about what jacob did for an elephant who was being abused by the circus boss. it was a fantastic read, im really glad i read it! highly recommended.,overall
This book glued me to the edge of my seat and held me there by my heartstrings. Very poignant account of a young man who came into his own not once but twice...a must-read!,overall
I just finished listening to this audio book and I have to say it was truly wonderful.  I felt the circus come alive, great imagery and historic detail.  You could picture the circus`s shows with great detail.  I listened to this while commuting and found myself really enjoying my drive to and  from  work, traffic and all. The only negative was the sex.  My tween daughter really wanted to read this book because of the movie trailer but I had to say no right away after just the first chapter or so.  It really didn't add that much to the story and wasn't needed.,overall
I loved this book, not only was it extremely entertaining...it was so informative. I learned so much. The circus never interested me, but since the book had such great reviews I decided to try it out.  I'm glad I did.  I highly recommend this book.  It is dark and creepy at some points, depressing, but there is just something about it... you will fall in love with Rosie.,overall
I absolutely loved this book. It was so well written and I was easily able to connect to the characters. I was gripping my seat the whole time I was reading this. It was phenomenal.,overall
Well-written, colorful characters, fun read. The authorised a great job of painting a vivid picture and making me feel like I was right there with the circus crew.,overall
This book is a MUST read.The other reviews are all true and helpful....... from the very first line this story carries you away.  The emotion invoked was strong.  There isn't any way to describe this book.  It moved me to anger, tears, horror, vindication.  In the end, I had a different outlook on entertainment involving animals and on the human being aging.,overall
Water for Elephants was mesmerizing.  Form beginning to end, the characters were compelling and the research meticulous.  I couldn't put the book down.,overall
As I neared the end of this book, I was so sad. It was just such a wonderful, rich, charming story that I wanted it to continue forever!I was completely enchanted by Gruen's story and way with words. From page 1 of the prologue, she had captured my full attention with vivid imagery and intriguing characters. When you read great historical fiction like this, it's hard not to get sucked into the world and time of the characters. Water for Elephants does this to perfection--my mind was transported back to Depression-era America, as I traveled on a train-circus, mingling with performers and working-men alike. It was a fun and fantastical adventure.Gruen's story, gritty at times and uplifting at others, is compelling to say the least--I never wanted to set this book down! I thought the author's technique of transporting the reader back and forth between Jacob's time with the Benzini Brothers and his later years spent at the nursing home was done magnificently. And it was the his nursing home days that really made Jacob such a well-developed and likeable main character.I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story! You will not be disappointed.,overall
Excellently written and completely absorbing.It's one of those rare books that has no part you will want to skim over or read through.The characters and the story linger in your mind long after you finish reading the book.The book itself is so good that it is easier to read than the best reviews here.,overall
I didn't realize this book had been out for so long when I ordered it from Amazon.  Can't believe I hadn't heard of it before because it was a fantastic book I should have picked up sooner.  I think a movie is being made about the book, but I am glad I read the book first.  It's a quick read for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Definitely entertaining.  After I finished it, I felt like I was still transported back to the 1930's circus, and it took several hours to stop thinking about it.  Worth reading for sure.,overall
A friend recommended this book to me and I very much enjoyed it I found this book to be very entertaining. At first I thought \I have no interest learning abot a circus\ but this book had a great story line. It held my attention and I couldn't put it down. I found the story to be descrptive enough to play like a movie as I read it (and no, I've not even seen the movie). I'm looking forward to reading other books by this author,overall
Changes how you look at things. Great read, it's a classic. I loved reading this book. It's still good in 2013.,overall
This was a book that was hard to put down and I have recommended it to all my reader friends.  I loved the way it jumped between when he was a young man and now an older man.  It also seems so realistic about how a person might feel when they are so elderly.  I really enjoyed it and I never will think of the circus the same way.,overall
My book club chose this book in the spring.  I decided not to read it at that time, despite the wonderful reviews.  Last week I picked it up to read while we were lounging at the cabin.  Wow!  What took me so long?This is one of the finest stories I've read in a long time.  It grabbed me in the beginning and pulled me through to the end.  It had a bit of everything---humor, adventure, romance, heartbreak.Water for Elephants is the story of a young man who accidentally joins a circus train in 1931.  Along with him we meet some wonderful characters---both human and animal.Spoiler Alert---I enjoy a story with a happy, yet satisfying ending.  This book did not disappoint.,overall
I could almost see Tom Hanks playing the lead character in the movie, even though I have not seen it.Would recommend this to anyone.,overall
just when I thought I knew what was coming, the story took another clever twist. this was definitely a page-turner of the highest magnitude.  don't miss it!,overall
This is a great story about love and the passage of time.  I normally do not read fiction, but took a chance on this book, and I'm so glad I did. The straight forward story telling keeps you in the moment. I thought about this tale long after I had finished reading it.  I would recommend it to anyone.,overall
I read this book about a year ago. I was a little unsure of the subject matter, however, the book pulled me in. I got very interested in the various characters, I found that it was one of my favorite books I read last year.,overall
This was a well written book.  Intriguing and kept me going until the book was all read.  I was hoping there would be a sequel but none so far.,overall
This book is very touching and entertaining. I was reluctant to read this but once I started, I just can't put it down. If you like to know about what it is like behind the circus' life, being old and left alone..pick this one. You will understand more how to deal with old people and what its in their mind... I have no doubt I will re read this book again in the future,overall
I just finished \Water for Elephants\ the day before yesterday!  I can't seem to find anything I want to read now as that story just won't go away.  It was far and beyond one of my favorite books.  I just loved it!  Once I started it, I couldn't put it down.  Now I want to see more pictures of the old circuses.  Amazing what she was able to capture with her words and that she could understand what an old man could be feeling and thinking.  I love it when I can find a book like hers.  I highly recommend it!,overall
This by far was one of the best books that I have read this year!  Ms. Gruen takes us there, to the Circus in the depression era, the whole experience was riviting from beginning to end.  I highly recommend this to anyone contemplating choosing this book, you will not be disappointed!  I look forward to reading her other published works, although it will be tough to top this one!,overall
Very interesting characters in this novel.  I honestly enjoyed the main character when he was old and young.  Highly recommended!,overall
At first I was skeptical about reading a book about a circus, but everyone I know that has read the book had given it great reviews.  I'm glad to say I was not disappointed.  The author did a great job with this book and detailing the era in which it is written.  I bought this book on my Kindle and can honestly say I could not put it down - the convenience of having my Kindle books available through apps on my cell phone / computer and the actual Kindle made it even harder to put down and all the more exciting to read.  I highly recommend this book, it did not disappoint in any way!,overall
I loved this book and the story is terrific.  I also thought the movie was done well.  Although I enjoy reading books more to get more of the details of the story which I think you miss in the movie.,overall
I wish I had written my review for this novel a lot sooner, as I finished it over three months ago, especially since I loved it so much.  I am unable to comment on all the details that made this book highly enjoyable, but nonetheless I wanted to add my review.One of the first things that piqued my interest was the fact that the main character was 93-years old (or was it 90?) which lent a different perspective to the storyline and resolution.  Jaocb, was a very likeable main character in his old age and in his youth, but was not the only character you felt invested in. The character of Walter (Kinko) with this dog Queenie was just as intriguing despite his secondary role in the story.  As well, the antagonist, August, was just as aptly developed, which made you fear his anger towards Marlena and Rosie.  Speaking of Rosie, as an animal-lover, I cared deeply for her safety and sucess in the future of the circus.I was surprised to find out that the author knew very little about the circus prior to writing this book, but she did an excellent job of researching to pull off a very believable background/setting for this story.The characters live with you long after the story is over and you find yourself wondering what happened to Mr. Jacob Jankowski as he started on a new adventure in his life at 93 (or was it 90?).,overall
Gripping and suspenseful. Kept me on the edge of my seat. I love romantic stories that have struggles and this definitely fulfilled that want.,overall
I read both of Sara Gruen's previous books - primarily because they were horse stories.  I was really looking forward to her next book and was disappointed to see that it wasn't about horses at all.  It hit the best seller list and I read the reviews.  It didn't appeal to me at all.  I read more reviews.  Eh. Finally, I decided to read it.  I'm so glad I did!  This is one of those books that draws you in on the first page and doesn't let you go until the end.  I'm recommending this to everyone I know -and I'm recommending it to you.  Read it - you won't be sorry.,overall
I really enjoyed this book - read it in 2 nights and in the end came away with a good feeling.  The insight into the old circus life was interesting & exciting.  The insight into how our elderly are treated was sad and eye opening.  Then in-between was woven love, adventure, friendship, animals, racism, murder, mystery, with a happy ending.  What more could you ask for?,overall
I bought this book based on the reviews, and I loved it. It may not be perfect, but it is a great, fun, easy read. Loved the ending!,overall
Water for Elephants gives you a peek at the life of circus performers and the crew during a time when jobs were scarce in America. The characters in the story are as colorful on stage as off. This is a book that you won't want to put down as the circus train weaves in and out of towns with the array of likable and seedy characters.  And just when you think you know how the story will end--you will discover you were wrong.,overall
If you read no other novel this year, make it this one.  This is perhaps the most extraordinary novel I've read in literally years, from an author with truly AWESOME talent.  Generally, I read almost nothing but mystery novels...and ones with \hard-bitten\ heroes, at that...not even a hint of anything sniveling.  I'm just not a touchie-feelie kind of girl.  So if a feel-good book like this can affect me so enormously, just think what it'll do for those of you who like this kind of stuff!  Only partly joking here; but truly, this is one magnificent work of literary art.  Inside glimpses of life in a 1930's circus are so intimately written and ring so true, that it's hard to believe Ms. Gruen isn't 90 years old, writing memoirs.  Each character is so artfully rendered that you care, and care deeply!, about every single one of them.  You love them or hate them, with equal measures of intensity.  Add the super special treat at the beginning of most chapters of real photos from these old circuses, and you have just a jewel of a book.  Obviously, I'm drooling all over myself in this review, but I can't recommend it strongly enough, to everyone, no matter your preferences in reading material.  I took a chance and am SO glad I did.  Oh, and Ms. Gruen has a sense of humor too!  There are parts of the book where I guarantee you will be unable to hold back from a big belly laugh, right out loud.  Please, get this book.  You will NOT regret a single minute of reading time.  I fully intend to go now and buy every book she's every written, hoping for another glimpse of her genius.,overall
An intriguingly wonderful history lesson that allows us a look at the history makers' heart! We all have feelings; we all need to express them. Thank you Mrs. Gruen.,overall
My two best friends and I are all avid readers, although we usually read very different books. One of them got it, loved it and gave it to me, and this book was passed around for several months. We had a mother in law, an ex boyfriend all reading it, which really speaks to how good the book is.You can read the other reviews to find out what its about...I'm telling you, you will be hooked instantly. Clear your schedule. This isn't a book you want to start reading when its going to be a week before you can pick it up again.,overall
This book is a must-read. I couldn't put it down in for the whole two days it took to read. In a way I've already imagined what it would be like as a movie- because the author uses such rich imagedry you feel like you're at the circus with Jacob and Marlena. It's really a facinating book- GO OUT AND BUY IT!!!!,overall
Stop reading reviews and buy the book! Seriously! The author took time to research old school circus art and politics. I truly enjoyed this book,overall
Water for Elephants is an awesome story about an engaging character that had me sneaking my kindle out at work to read a bit more.I loved it from start to finish. Some have criticized the amalgamation of the Jacob story from the Bible and post depression circuses but it works beautifully.The level of detail and insight into the train circus world shows an incredible amount of research but one of the most amazing things is none of those details come across as research. They are as natural to the story as the characters.,overall
Not being, even remotely, a Robert Pattinson fan and not liking circuses either, I put off reading this book for several months after it was purchased.  I still couldn't help visualizing Robert Pattinson as the lead character, but eventually, the story took over and Robert faded a little.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I really liked the book.  Well written, good story line and a bit of a surprise ending.  Still won't watch the movie (that Robert thing again) but the book is always better anyway.,overall
I loved this book, even though I have sold a lot of my books because of a lack of shelf space, this one I will always keep. Have already recommended it to many of my friends. Don't want to say anything about the story, it is a treasure.,overall
What a delightful read!  Water for Elephants has got to be one of the best reads for anyone that likes animals, circuses, and a very wonderfully flowing story.  Working in or for a circus, especially in past years, had to be one of the most grueling and tough jobs to tackle.  Sara Gruen makes the reader smell the circus smells, taste the midway foods, and be in the ring with the animals as they entertain.  I have not been to a circus since I was a teenager, which is MANY years ago.  Water for Elephants took me back to those days reminding me of some of the things I saw and smelled.His family placed Jacob Jankowski in a home for old folks because none of them wanted to \have\ to take care of him.  Sad, but true.  Jacob is not sure if he is ninety or ninety-three years of age.  He only knows his age is somewhere around that range.  Jacob hates the other old people in the home, hates the food, and hates the nurses that treat him like he does not know what he is doing or saying.  This is no life for Jacob Jankowski!The story then goes back to when Jacob was in Cornell College studying to be a veterinarian.  He was shy about women; wanted nothing to do with them socially.  Jacob thought he must be the worlds oldest male virgin.  Jacob does well with his schooling until one day he was called out of class and told that both of his parents had been killed in an automobile accident.  Jacob, of course, was crushed, mentally and physically.  This couldn't be happening to him.  His parents had been paying his way through college so he figured he could continue his education with whatever his parents left him.  His father was also a veterinarian with a good practice.  Jacob was beside himself when he was told that all the property his parents owned was being taken because of no funds to pay for the bills.  It turns out that his father bartered with his customers as they paid him in chickens, eggs, animals, or whatever they had, but not money.This upset Jacob so much that he just took off walking and walking until he came to a rail track that had a train moving that he was going to jump on regardless of where it was going.  Thus Jacob began his circus life when he jumped that train and met other circus performers and roustabouts.  He had no idea what lie ahead.  His inclusion into the circus life was difficult, as the circus does not like young rubes being around experienced circus people.  When they found out he was \almost\ a veterinarian, they were elated, as they had no one to medically care for the animals.  This gave Jacob a ticket into circus life.As I said originally, the author makes you feel as though you were in the circus troupe as they raised their tents, did their shows, ate the food available, got paid when there was money, running away from the law when one or more in the circus caused a problem with the law or local authorities, traveled on the circus train never knowing for sure where they would end up, putting up with the circus owner and top management that treated most of the help like dirt.Of course there was much in the book about personal lives of the circus employees and owners.  Also how the circus obtained more animals and equipment legally or otherwise.  It is an eye opener for anyone to read.  It makes one wonder how these circus people existed in those days of traveling and living such an uncertain existence.The story does occasionally go back to Jacob in the home in which he is so unhappy.  The circus comes to town and sets up right next to the home, making Jacob so excited to be so close to the circus, even though it is not one of the ones he worked when younger.  The days passed so slowly as he waited for his family to come and take him to his big visit to the big top.I doubt anyone could read this book without coming away with a great understanding of those old circus days and what they meant to the people that worked that hard life.  You will know that Sara Gruen put much time and effort in her research for Water for Elephants.  You WILL enjoy this book.  It will entertain you and educate you at the same time.,overall
Saw the movie before getting the book which I downloaded from Kindle.  Really liked the movie and then decided to buy the book.  The book is an easy read and if you ever have been to a circus or were curious about behind the scenes then you will probably enjoy the book. If you are looking for a deep mystery then this is probably not for you but if you like love stories and don't want to have to keep a notepad beside you to jot down things to remember so as not to get lost or confused in the story then this is the book for you.  I loved reading it on lazy days when I didn't have to concentrate real hard but could let my mind and imagination get lost in the characters and their telling of the story.  This Kindle book was downloaded immediately without any problems as usual.,overall
This books was one of my favorites for the year. This book flashes from present day Jacob, 93 living in a nursing home to Jacob's summer traveling with the circus during the 1930's Depression era. Not only do you have these rich circus characters and animals, but also you have the interesting time period. The writing is flawless, the characters/animals (Rosie, my favorite) are amazing, the plot keeps you interested, and you root for the Jacob in the past and his present condition.The slight twist in the whodunit revealed near the end was also suprising,overall
Love the story and character development.  Writing was eloquent.  It read and played out like a movie and was bitter sweet.,overall
This fabulous tale (written \The Notebook\ style) drew me in right from the beginning and I literally couldn't stop reading, until...I was nearly finished and I had to put it down because didn't want the story to end.,overall
Although it is only April, I predict that Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen will be one of the best books I read this year.  Gruen has proven to be an amazing storyteller.Water for Elephants is told in the first person but from two different perspectives--Jacob Jankowski at 23 years of age and again, at 93 years old.  Gruen seamlessly weaves the chapters between past and present.  Jacob at 23 is finishing up his last semester at Cornell Veterinary School when a family tragedy causes him to flee.  He finds himself on a train for the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth in 1931.  Needing a vet, the circus hires young Jacob to tend to their menagerie.  Jacob at 93 resides in a nursing home where he laments the curses of old age, the passing of his wife, and the waning affection of his family.  The arrival of a visiting circus triggers a flashback to his youthful circus experiences.1931 is a hard time for almost all Americans, and the circus workers are as hard hit as any.  Most are one step away from being homeless and jobless.  Conditions on the circus train are harsh for most.  Many workers go weeks without being paid, and they tend to disappear during the night when times are tough (management has them thrown off the train).  The menagerie is often times treated better than the workers.  But the circus does provide three meals a day and a place to sleep--even it if might mean a horse blanket on a train bed floor.  Jacob discovers very quickly that he's just about the only advocate the animals have and he must battle a ruthless owner (Uncle Al) and a crazy animal trainer (August).Any circus has more than their fair share of interesting characters, and Gruen's circus is no exception.  In addition to Uncle Al and August, there is Walter (the midget clown), Marlena (an equestrian with whom Jacob falls in love), and Grady and Camel (workers).  One of the most sympathetic characters in Water for Elephants is Rosie, the elephant--who shares more \human\ characteristics and feelings than some of the circus bosses.  The tender-hearted Jacob quickly grows to manhood as he is forced to protect both animals and coworkers from abuse and worse.Water for Elephants is a delightful, moving book, and the ending was a very pleasant surprise.  Also, if you want a special treat, listen to it on audiobook.  The two readers, David LeDoux and John Randolph Jones, did a wonderful job of bringing both Jacobs (young and old) to life.,overall
I love depression era stories and to hear it from a circus's perspective was pretty cool. I lived right beside the place where they had the county fair every year so found the carney part of it very interesting.,overall
This was an unexpectedly wonderful book.  Witty, funny and exceptionally moving.  Who would have thought the circus is as bureaucratic and complicated as the corporate world!  The glimpse into life on a traveling circus was an enlightening and refreshing backdrop from which to catapult some of the themes we all face in our daily lives.  This book narrates the life of Jacob Janowski, an aspiring vet who is left orphaned and hops aboard what he soon learns is a train belonging to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth!This book is full of hearty laughs and painful disappointments. You will fall in love with Jacob's relentless can-do attitude and his inherent affection and commitment towards those he grows to love.  Rosie the elephant will touch you in ways you cannot imagine.  There is a certain depth around the love that animals exude.  It is silent and unspoken yet so powerful.  Rosie is intelligent and caring and through her vigilant eyes and silent actions is a magnificent portrayal of loyalty and friendship.  Walter the clown is another character to whom I grew very attached.  He is the typical insecure cynic whose interior consists of nothing but a soft shell.  He embodies the spirit of change and devotion and camaraderie.  This incredible cast of characters makes this a book of overwhelming depth.`Water for Elephants' was a surprisingly poignant story that is brimming with emotion.  The characters are so authentic; their memory will remain with you well after the pages of this book have ended.  It was a truly unique and enjoyable read.  Highly recommended.,overall
I really enjoyed reading this book. I had to do so through tears most of the time. I really loved the way she wrote the story from both perspectives of Jacob as a young man and as an old man. It helped it mean more to me to read about it from his memory. It reminded me of what treasures we have in our elderly. I also loved to see all the old pictures, they were great. On the down side of the book there was more then needed sex and bad language in the story for me. But that's just me. I do like the book and am very glad I read it. I would suggest it to other adults to read.,overall
I read this book in a day. A day. I just sat and read and read and couldn't put it down.For those unfamiliar with the plot, Jacob Jankowski is 90. Or 93. He is living in an \assisted living\ home. One day, the residents notice a circus going up near the home, and it brings back a flood of memories for Jacob. He unfolds for the reader the story of his time with the Benzini Brothers Circus in 1931; of how he met Marlena, Walter, Camel, and a cast of other characters, especially Rosie, who is one amazing elephant (I fell in love with her, too). It was an incredible ride, and I'm not sure how to summarize it better than that.Gruen's descriptions are so apt one can smell the animals, the popcorn, the sawdust, and the sweat. It's an incredible achievement. The entire spectacle is so vivid that you'll swear all the people contained in its pages are real and breathe, or did once. It's the kind of book that makes you forget you're reading a book and transports you to another time and place, and it's definitely earned a place on my favorites shelf.If you, like me, have waited to read this one, do yourself a favor and read it now.,overall
This book already has over 3,500 positive reviews on Amazon and every one of them is well deserved. This book was a wonderful treasure. I eargerly awaited each time in my day when my schedule allowed fiction reading so I could get back to this story. The characters are three dimensional, compelling, and as genuine as your next door neighbors or your long-lost aunts and uncles. The circus setting was fascinating, and the story-telling was first-rate, doesn't get much better than this. I highly recommend this book. I haven't seen the movie (yet), but if it's even half as good as the book it will be tremendous.,overall
This story, about a young man who runs away to the circus, is beautiful in the way it paints an older man near the end of his life in a loving, endearing way. Older people are real people whose value is in no way diminished. In fact, they have lived their life and survived life's most difficult challenges. And yet despite all they've learned and know, they are given so little respect. Every day they courageously cope with challenges that most of us have never even come close to experiencing. Even their family often treats them callously, or worse, like little children. Some older folk are cranky, like the character in this story, but considering what they've been through, they deserve kindness in return, not defensiveness. The treatment of this older man by nurse Rosemary in this book has inspired me to love older people and respect them more.,overall
Very interesting story.  Lots of great characters and interesting story line. I hesitated to start reading this because I thought it was \just a love story\, how glad I am that I did read it. The characters and situations were great and very interesting.,overall
It had my attention from the first page to the last.  Absolutely brilliant!  Could not put it down.,overall
Sara Gruen spoke about how her literary agent turned down Water for Elephants in the talk she gave last year for the Rosamond Gifford Lecture Series, the largest library related lecture series in the country sponsored by the Friends of the Central Library (Onondaga County System, Central New York). This was the second (or third ?) book she had done with that agent. She told the audience of 2,500 people that when she proposed the manuscript to the agent, the agent told her, \There's no market for books about circuses\ and turned the book down. Sara's response, as I recall, was, \What books about circuses?\ This got a big laugh from the audience most of whom had read Water for Elephants. All wannabe authors writing anything other than romance, historical fiction and vampires take note. There is hope for you.She is not only an outstanding writer, but also an engaging speaker. I personally enjoyed the book immensely although I was a little uncomfortable with the first person present point of view. She struggled a little with probability at the end but I especially liked the little illustrations liberally sprinkled throughout the book that she had obtained from the Ringling folks in Sarasota.,overall
An amazingly beautiful story, Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants is the tale of Jacob Jankowski and the 3 months that he worked for the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth circus. When we meet Jacob, he is in his 90s, living in a nursing home and reliving his days with the Benzini Brothers circus. It was through a chance encounter after the death of his parents that caused him to leave veterinary school and put his fate with the circus.I was really surprised by how quickly the story captured my attention. The novel jumps back and forth from \now,\ where we see Jacob dealing with the trials of old age, and \then,\ as he remembers his days with the Benzini Brothers circus, and how those days formed him into the man that he would grow to become. The sequences are fluid, though, and you find yourself easily swept along with the story. Sara Gruen's prose is amazing; I found myself on several occasions holding my breath, I was so wrapped up in the story. Gruen clearly portrays her characters emotions and captures each of their voices and personalities perfectly and her portrayal of the lives of the circus folk in the 1920s-30s was very grim. It was amazing to me that so many people would live that kind of life, but I guess when that was the only work to be had, they'd take what they could get.Gruen seems to have done her research as well. Even though the Benzini Brothers circus is fictitious, I think it was clearly influenced by any number of circus' in operation at the time. She also makes reference to several actual circus events (such as the Hartford Circus Fire of 1944 and the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus train accident of 1918). Even down to the band playing \The Stars and Stripes Forever\ during an emergency, Gruen seems to have done her homework on circus life.If you haven't read this yet, I'd really recommend it. I'd had the book on my shelf since it was released (I was caught up in the buzz, but never got around to actually reading it) and after 2 friends mentioned it a couple weeks back, I decided to take it off the shelf and give it a try. I'm sorry that it took me that long to get around to reading it.,overall
Liked this novel very much.  Maybe it's because I am olde and can remember Circuses like the one depicted.  Where I came from (upstate New York) it was a true portrayal of the circus coming to town in the 1930's.Would definitely recommend the book to others.,overall
Loved this book!  Very, cool and original book, great read!  As always very happy with the customer service and the product!,overall
This wonderful book shot through the family like water through an elephant's trunk, as my father, my wife and I all read it in the space of two weeks. Gruen writes the most enjoyable kind of historical fiction, focused on a fascinating time and setting that the reader probably knew next to nothing about before starting the book. In this case, the scene is the American traveling circus of the early 1930's, just after the start of the Depression. The protagonist operates in two time periods, as a nonagenarian in a current day \assisted living facility\ and flashing back to his days as a young veterinary student who due to circumstances beyond his control ends up serving as the vet for a traveling circus. Gruen intended to imagine various vignettes for the book, but in her research and interviews with circus veterans discovered stories from real life that were even better--a real-life case of truth being stranger than fiction. The assisted living facility is inevitably less interesting than the world of freaks and geeks in a circus, but Gruen handles the voice of the aged just as deftly as that of the young vet.  The book is enhanced by actual pictures from various circus archives. Not an especially profound book, \Water For Elephants\ still gets a five-star rating for all readers for readability and Gruen's ability to evoke an interesting place and time so well, along with a surprising and touching, albeit a little far-fetched, ending.,overall
Following the main character in his twenties and in his nineties was very engaging. There were some points where scenes were brushed over, but they usually involved violence (to animals or people), so it's probably just as well. I loved listening to it rather than reading it, because it made it come alive.,overall
Amazing book!! Starts off slowly and snowballs into a fabulous tale... you won't be disappointed!!,overall
I loved this book from page one!  Obviously much research was done by the author, as the descriptions of circus life during the depression are very realistic, believable, mundane and exciting.  There were times I choked up, times I laughed out-loud and times I was simply entertained by the descriptions of aging.  Would highly recommend.  This was a book I did not want to put down, and was saddened when it ended...I wanted to continue reading about Jacob.,overall
The hardship of a young man after the death of his parents and what a man endures for the love of a woman.,overall
I won't try to tell you what this book is about....there are many other reviews here that can do that much better than I can....I just want to let you know how it made me feel.I had the miraculous privilege of growing up with all of our \ole folk\.  Both sets  of my great-grandparents lived well into their 90's. For anyone who had this kind of wonder in their lives, you know what a blessing that was....and for those who didn't.....well my heart aches for your not knowing what you missed.  Watching and listening to; in particular, my Grand-dad E. was both heart breaking and fabulous!  His mind was sharp and exact till the end...even though sometimes his physical self didn't follow suit the way he thought it should.  Even with all of the frustration that came with getting older and losing control of parts of his life, he always had advice to give and stories to tell.  I would stay up at the barn with him all through the summer days, helping him work on his projects while he explained to me how to tell when a snake was venomous or showing me how to brush the horses out at the end of the day, because no matter how tired you where...they had worked harder.  I am filled with memories of sitting and listening to him telling tales of when he was in his 20's and 30's and what they all did to get by during the depression. He also made sure I knew how wonderful it was to get sit out in the field you'd been working in all day and eat your fill of the melons that were being harvested.  Reading this book was like sitting in that barn all of those years ago listening to this man that I love so much, tell me about a world that we can't even imagine while he showed me the right way to do things in the world that I lived in now.Reading this book was like spending those summers with my Grand-dad. Sara Gruen made me feel the train swaying as it ran through the night and let me smell the smell of the animals as they stood in the heat of the day waiting to be tended to.  She let me cry over the hardship of the lives that these poor men and women lived then let me feel the excitement of hearing the music start up for the shows.  She had my stomach aching for want of a bite to eat...to then have my mouth water when the flag finally went up over the cook tent.  Of all of the books that I've ever read, Water for Elephants, ranks high up in the ones that made me forget myself and drift into the world that had been put down in the pages.While pregnant with my oldest son, I helped care for my Grand-dad and as he had been an enthusiastic reader most of his life...when his eye sight began to fail I read to him.  I wish I'd had this book to read to him.  He would have been as lost to it's wonder as I have been these last two day..Mrs. Gruen....amazing.  Simply amazing.,overall
I just finished reading this and I expect it will be the best book of fiction that I read this year. I usually buy a book for Christmas each year for a friend and an elderly aunt. This is the book for 2007! My only disappointment is that Sara Gruen does not have a long list of other books for me to read. I also loved the photos that were at the beginning of the chapters. Sara Gruen is going to the top of the list of my favorite authors!!,overall
I didn't want this book to ever end!  I thoroughly fell in love with Jacob.  Sigh.,overall
Absolutely loved it!  Couldn't putit down til the end.  Always wanted to see the movie but now am glad I read the book instead,overall
There are endless ways to sing the praises of this novel of one man's surreal life in a circus.  Water for Elephants ranks as one of the top five books on my list of best and most shocking endings.  I just didn't see that ending coming.  I gasped when I learned the truth. Water for Elephants is a haunting story.,overall
This was a wonderful book. This is a must read. The author did an amazing job flashing back and forth from present to past. You won't be able to put it down!,overall
I didn't expect to like it, hadn't heard anything about, was reading it as a duty for a book club.  Boy, was I surprised! Had to stay up til midnight, (on a work day)to finish it once I'd started it.  Got totally involved with the story.  Loved the style.,overall
Fascinating story of growth, witth very unique, unforgetable chararcters.  It exposes the dark side of human nature, compared with the unconditional love of the animals.,overall
Water for Elephants is the definitive  novel on love and compassion in the midst of unspeakable pain and despair. It is on my list of five best and most unexpected endings mainly for the secret that Jacob keeps his whole life.  There are so many incredible little secrets about life in this book just waiting to be discovered.  The plot is riveting.  It's an incredibly fast read and it is truly as magical as a circus.,overall
Everyone should read this book.  It not only is a love story but opened up the world of the traveling circus, making me aware of how brutal their life could be.,overall
This is such a great story such a wonderful wonderful story! I loved every word and every image painted in my head. This is not a predictable little book it is awesome!,overall
This is one of my all-time favorites!  For some reason, I put off reading this book for months.  I tried to convince myself that it didn't look interesting.  Was I ever wrong!  This will stay in my house, I will not trade or sell it, or loan it out.  It's that good!  Reading the author's notes, I discovered it was based on the the Biblical story of Jacob.  Then I had to read it all over again!  And I still loved it!,overall
If you saw the movie that goes with this book, the movie doesn't do it justice. I thought it was a really good book and enjoyed it much more than the movie.,overall
Water for Elephants begins a bit slowly.  I recommended it to many people and they always said \I had trouble getting into it.\  I encouraged them to continue on and nobody was disappointed.I felt it was the best ending of any book I have EVER read.  When I got to the last few pages, I literally said out loud, \YES!  That's EXACTLY how this story should have ended\.Don't pass this one up.  It is an excellent book.,overall
Loved the premise, loved the characters, loved the descriptions, loved the time period, and as a child, loved the circus. After reading this book, the circus never looked quite the same. A great story filled with historical detail, romance, mystery, animal cruelty--you name it, this great read covered it.,overall
I had this book recommended to me! And to that I say thank you! I know the movie is supposed to be good but the book is fantastic. I now need to see if the movie compares.  I didn't think I would enjoy jumping back and forth from past to present but it fit the writing perfectly. I couldn't put it down and just wanted to know everything about Jacob. I felt like I was on the train with them!,overall
This book was great but very different from what I normally read.  With that being said I really enjoyed it!  Some of the parts involving the animals disturbed me, I'm a total animal lover, but I had to remind myself that that was reality back then and despite those parts, I really loved it.  Rosie was by far my favorite character and the ending was great.  I hope the movie doesn't butcher this beautiful story.,overall
This was ordered for my sisters book club. Not sure how the book was as I never read it since it was for a gift.,overall
I totally enjoyed the book.  It seems that everyone that reads it gets something different from it... a love story, an animal rights story, a human right story, etc.,overall
This is a wonderfully poignant book that slides seamlessly between the 90 Plus year old Jacob, and his remembrances of his youth when he was 23 and spent time with a traveling circus as its Veterinarian.  The frailities of Jacob who is now in the Nursing Home is portrayed so realistically that it almost seems like those parts of the story are actually written by an old person.  In counterpoint, the story of the younger Jacob's traveling circus adventures seems the same way, as if the author has actually experienced this lifestyle.  With twists and turns, heart melting moments of happiness, heart-wrenching moments of anger and sadness, this book is one that, once started, is hard to put down.  You'll be glad you chose this book to read.,overall
This is the best book I've read in years I couldn't Put it down  It heald my interest so well.,overall
I loved this book. Throughout, I felt like I was actually at this circus. I felt like I could smell the popcorn. I felt like I could hear the sounds of the animals, the train leaving in the night, or the audience expressing their delight. I really could not put the book down because I had to know what happened next. Very good.,overall
What a wonderful story....Well written!So many details make you really envision the whole story.Definitely a great read. Highly recommend it!,overall
One day I was surfing Amazon looking for a good read. There are times when I'm looking for something different that I just go with a good title. Sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised, other times I'm not. This was a pleasant surprise. I'd never heard of the book or the author so I came in on a clean slate. It was a wonderful read, one of those books you hate to put down for mundane things such as work and sleep. I was instantly hooked on the main character, Jake, and the life he led. Sad in spots, dark and violent in some places, bittersweet at times, it was one of those stories that pulled me right in and made it hard to say goodbye when it was over.,overall
Loved this book. It is a wonderful love story. It gave me an idea of what goes on in an older persons mind  .,overall
I am not real sure what I expected going into this book, more of a romance \chick\ book I guess. I don't really like romance books all that much so it was awhile before I actually read this book but wishing now I had read it sooner! It was NOTHING like I thought it was going to be at all!This book is about a 93 year old man in a assistant living home that is recalling the time he spent in the circus as a young man after his parents got killed in a car accident. I was really expecting it to be more happy upbeat book about the circus but there was very little \happy\ in this book! Some parts were so hard to read and I had to keep myself reading, not because the writing was bad or the book was bad but because some parts were just heart wrenching that it was hard to read without crying or at least on the verge of it, or wanting to go and kill August!The writing was amazing the author has amazing talents and I never expected the ending! I was actually fairly pissed off when Jacob didn't get to go to the circus and was thinking that I was going to be pretty upset with the ending but it caught me off guard and I ended the book smiling and crying at the same time.Amazing book read it!,overall
I have read a bunch of novels recently that kept me engrossed for the first 70-80% and then faded badly. Water for Elephants is worth reading right to the satisfying ending. It is very well paced and has interesting twists and all the characters seemed real to me.I had never considered the 1930's touring circus as a basis for writing a novel. Now I want to learn more about it. That's because Gruen does such a nice job describing it. The characters (and the animals!) are very human and I think she captures the time they lived in quite well. I am impressed that there are over 1000 reviews and still more coming for a book that's been out now for over 4 years. It speaks to some of the universal qualities that appealed to me and perhaps other readers. The lead character is interesting, he's human and he has reflected on a life well lead while  yearning for more. I see a little bit of my father in there!One thing I am always looking for is how well a writer can give voice to a character that is so different from him or herself. Ms Gruen as a modern woman writing in the first person a man in the 1930's does very well in making Jacob a believable character. The writing is tight, swift and it was a pleasure to read.,overall
I love the way this book ended. This was the best ending I have experienced in a long time. The story is gripping and a pleasure to read. At times I could not put it down, the need to know what was going to happen next was thoroughly enjoyable.,overall
I just finished reading Water for Elephants and I really enjoyed it. It's a love story and so much more. The author conjured up images so sharp and clear that I often thought of the classic movie The Greatest Show on Earth (directed by Cecil B. DeMille). The characters were well-fleshed and it was obvious from the beginning who was the 'hero' and who was the 'villain', both vying for the beautiful heroine. And then there was a secondary story set in present day that was artfully woven among the vintage circus story. I really enjoyed this book. The author did a fabulous job of drawing in the reader, and I found myself longing for bedtime (my reading time &lt;g>). I know this book has been optioned for a movie and I do hope the director does the book justice.,overall
The Carnival life isn't easy.  Being chucked off the rails, the mistreatment of animals.  This story though, brings the Carnival life to life.  The ending was beautiful.  So masterfully done.  The book was so much better than the movie.  If you have not seen the movie (which by now I am sure you have), read the book, you feel each and every character like it were you.,overall
For several years, various animal rights organizations have campaigned against circuses, citing the cruelty inflicted upon animals.  Gruen shows how cruelty permeated the institution.This is a wonderful novel about love and decadence, greed and control, and cruelty and tenderness.  It starts weakly, where the protagonist discovers his parents were killed in a freak traffic accident.  He hops a train, and winds up working for a circus.  But don't despair, I promise it's worth finishing.Gruen's characters are vividly drawn.  Hierarchies amongst performers, workers and management prevail.  Descriptions are so vivid, you can almost smell the hay, and everything else so accurately described.This is a wonderful window into life in a circus, with all it's horrors and despite them, it's draw.Well done!,overall
Excellent book, the way it is written and what you get out of the book.Would recommend this book highly.,overall
What a great novel. Could not put it down. I could picture everything as described. The author really did her homework. Did not see the movie but do not think it can be as good as the book.,overall
I love the novel, Water for Elephants. It is the exciting tale of a young, veterinary student who ends up working for a third-rate, somewhat corrupt, traveling circus. He cares for the circus animals, while encountering danger, episodes of animal cruelty, violence and romance. It is a heart-pounding and endearing tale, told mostly in flashback.  The characters are larger-than-life, from the cruel circus owner, to the sideshow freaks, to the bawdy young ladies who perform for the grinning men - both onstage ... and off. I just loved this book from start to finish. And for those of you who have seen the film, the book has much more action, and less focus on the romantic angle. An action-packed, colorful story. I could not put it down.,overall
This is one of the best books I've read in years.  Well researched, terrifically written!!  An unusual, little documented slice of American History.  HOORAY!!,overall
This book takes you on an adventure about life.  My girlfriend \the book worm\ read this twice before I had a chance to read it.  Now that I have read it I know why.  Captivating from beginning to end.  I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to go on a circus adventure.,overall
I LOVED this book!  It takes me awhile to read a book due to lack of time but, I couldn't wait to pick this up at every opportunity possible.  Great story, wonderful detail - and the type of book where you felt like you were on the sidelines watching.,overall
It was a time when I judged a book by it's cover, which I am told to never do.  I am so glad that I read this book.  It has stuck with me since I finished it and it is a book that I will read again and again.,overall
One of the Stern Librarian's great challenges is to get patrons who say they don't like novels to read them.  Water for Elephants is the novel I will now be pressing on those people who say they only like reading history or biography rather than fiction.  Although readers will get lost in the invented world in this book, they will also learn a great deal of real facts about the Depression, train circuses and animal behavior along the way.  And they will feel the plight of Americans in the grip of economic panic in ways that most history books cannot convey.  Photographs at the beginning of most chapters both illustrate the plot and confirm that most of this unbelievable story really did happen.  I particularly loved learning about the mechanics of circuses, how they were set up, taken down, how the crowd was shaken for every last nickel, how they performers and animals were fed and housed.  The paperback edition contains an interview with the author and other notes that describe the research that went into the book and reveal that a few of the more amazing events in the novel actually occurred.  As if the glamour of old circuses weren't enough, this book also contains a second story set in present day about an elderly man in a nursing home.  Many readers have told me that they take to this old man's voice like elephants to lemonade.  The Stern Librarian (I work for peanuts too).,overall
This is a super book about a very interesting subject. Great, well written story about the Circus world and its seamier side. Sometimes gritty, but interesting all the way through. one of my all-time favorites.,overall
A friend loaned me her copy even knowing that this isn't my normal genre. I kept it for several weeks on the shelf  and finally, I decided that I should read it. I am so glad I did! I thoroughly enjoyed this book. This book took me to another place and time and it felt that I was right beside the main character as he was going through his journey.,overall
This book was a bestseller, but in case you missed it, it's not too late. That's the thing about a great book - it never gets old. Read this, if you haven't already.,overall
This book was a very easy read. Loved the story line. It was great to be able to purchase kindle edition.,overall
Almost every child has dreamed about running away to join the circus.  In the days of the big top, there were lots of menial jobs that kept those who wanted to be part of the circus busy from before dawn into late into the night, even if those jobs often involved nothing more glamorous than shoveling up the remains of an elephant's snack.Water for Elephants starts with an elderly (at least 90 years old) Jacob Jankowski remembering snatches of his past as he frets over the indignities of living in a nursing home while his children ignore him except for token rotating visits on Sundays.  One memory in particular stands out, a violent memory that he didn't share with anyone for over 70 years.Most of the book moves through flashback into the 1930s when America was broke and people were starving.  Into this challenging world, Jacob has high expectations as he finishes up his veterinary training at Cornell.  But the hand of God intervenes, and his life will never be the same.He soon finds himself serving in any role that he can get at BENZINI BROS MOST SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH (as the rail cars read).  This isn't the big time.  It's just surviving by staying one step ahead of the local sheriffs while not delivering on promised acts and providing entertainment for men that has nothing to do with being a circus.  This circus doesn't even have an elephant.Much of the story involves the nitty gritty of how circuses operated in those perilous times.  It's a story that encompasses lots of cruelty, deceit, and harshness.  In fact, it's enough to make you wonder why you ever dreamed about running away to join the circus.  So if you would like to keep that dream shiny, perhaps this wouldn't be the best book for you to read.At the center of the story are three people and one elephant.  Marlena is the queen of the circus, the star of the equestrian act that involves first 12 and later 10 horses.  She's married to the volatile August who runs the animal acts.  When Jacob becomes involved in caring for the animals, Jacob is invited to dine and party with the couple.  The relationship becomes more complicated when Jacob finds himself drawn to Marlena and repelled by August.  When the circus buys an abandoned elephant that seems unusually stupid, the equilibrium is destroyed.Ultimately, the book is about responsibility and loyalty . . . qualities that are more important in and taken more seriously by the circus world than by the \rubes\ who attend the circus.  The message will serve as yet another indictment of our modern world which favors efficiency over doing the right thing.The book is beautifully illustrated with vintage photographs of early circuses that nicely match the story line of Water for Elephants.Unlike many authors of such historical fiction, Sara Gruen does a good job of keeping a few surprises up her sleeve.  So don't quit mid-book thinking you know how the story will turn out.Grab a shovel . . . and dig in!,overall
As a prize-winning author myself, and a Pulitzer nominee, I know good writing.  This book was so riveting and fascinating I couldn't put it down.In fact, it became so real to me that I began to think of it as non-fiction some time after I'd finished.  I had to read these reviews to recollect it is fiction.  Having read a great many of the posted reviews, I can't help noticing the negative or low rated reviews are sneering and superior, and critical in the extreme.  This is, in my experience, typical of poor writers who feel compelled to comment scathingly on others' skills, but who are incapable of writing compelling literature themselves.  As a professional academic reviewer, I strongly disagree with the snide commentary.  It is a rare gem.,overall
I was hesitant to read this book at first because I was concerned about the animal abuse. However, Sara Gruen did a wonderful job with keeping it at a minimum. I quickly scanned over one or two of the scenes and then realized when I was done reading the story, how the little bit of it added to the story.Well researched and well defined, Gruen takes you by the hand and leads you into the life of an elderly man who, from a nursing home, reflects back on his life in his younger years while he was a part of the circus life. Vivid and captivating, I felt as though I was a part of this exciting journey.There are thousands of reviews on this book, so I'll keep mine brief. Clearly stated, this is one work that will remain in my memory all the days of my life. Fascinating!!,overall
This review originally appeared on my blog.If you are considering trying audio books, I think this would be an excellent one to start with. I loved the narrators, they really added something extra to the story. Also this story is meant to be told orally and listening to it really makes it all come to life.I was a bit worried when I decided to listen to this book. I don't usually like books that involve animals, mostly because of the guaranteed heart fail. Not only does this book have animals, it is set in a circus. Having worked as a zookeeper, I learned some of the not so nice things that happen to circus animals. Then add to it, the story is set during the Depression. All of these had me cringing a bit. But who hasn't dreamed of running off to the circus?I was hooked in the first few minutes of the reading. I could tell that it would be a story I would lose myself in. I have to say though I was a little annoyed with the music playing in the background. Particularly with the older narrator as it made it difficult for me to hear him clearly.Oddly enough, it was the scenes of the older Jacob that had tears coming to my eyes, rather than the animals. It sucks to be old and his story is probably far more common than not. Though I did cringe every time August had a scene with Rosie. I was also a little shocked at the debauchery that took place at a circus (today it is such a family event).The descriptive nature of the story had me feeling like I was there at the circus. I could smell the popcorn. hear the cheer of the crowd, and when I closed my eyes I was in the menagerie with all the sights and sounds that come with a tent full of animals. More so than any other audio book I've listened to, there was a mini movies running through my mind.I went to see the movie a couple of days after finishing the book. I don't usually like to see the movie version so soon after finishing a book because the details of the book are so fresh in my mind. But I have to say, the movie was so well done that I fell even more in love with the story. The movie left out the parts that I found annoying in the book (in particular the back and forth between the old Jacob and young Jacob). I do have to say that I was a tiny bit upset that BoBo was cut from the film. I think he might have been my favorite animal.,overall
This book left me with a insight into the circus world and wanting to read more and more. I loved the way she incorporated the thoughts of the older character into the story, it really makes a person realize how aging feels. I really liked the characters and felt like I knew them personally!,overall
With a title like that who would have known how captivated I would be with a circus story. Well, I was.,overall
Movie was good but doesn't compare to the book.  Like all good books it was hard to put down.  Recommend it.,overall
This was a book that was recommended to me by a friend. I kept telling him that I really didn't want to read it, it didn't sound like something I would like. I WAS SO WRONG! This was a fabulous book! I could not put it down! I highly recommend it!,overall
Wonderfully drawn characters, brilliant writing and a fascinating setting not often written about in novels. What more could you ask of a book?,overall
I have seen this book on the shelves for sometime now and only just got around to reading it. It was so enjoyable that I read it in a day, I just couldn't put it down. The main character, Jacob, is intriguing without being over complicated. It is a peek into the history of the circus, all the while swirling a great mystery and love affair that will keep you glued to this page turner. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, mysteries, and a truly good read.,overall
No need for a long review here...This one is definately worth reading.  A great story,written well.  Highly recommend!,overall
Water for Elephants is highly fascinating, both in plot develoment as well as historical presentation. Gruen obviously invested an abundance of time researching the subject because the novel is rich with sensory imagery. Some folks may be bothered by the seedy side of the circus, but I don't think Gruen's goal was to paint a manufactured tale of such transitory, poor misfits.,overall
great.  everything you want in a great novel from characters you really care about to surpriises to viilains you hate to real adventure to circus history and personal romance. hard to put down.,overall
I really enjoyed this book as I found it a very quick read with characters I was interested in.Water for elephants is told by an ornery man (Jacob Jankowki, about 90 years old), whose life now consists of residing in an assisted living center, where his children visit when they can.The story goes back and forth from his life in the present, to his life in the past, when by a turn of fate, he found himself traveling with the Benzini Brothers Circus, as their Vet.  The time is the 1920-1930's  and we get to see life during The Great Depression.Their are many eccentric characters, and if you love the circus and animals, there is plenty of that for you.  I found the story of the circus performers lives fascinating.  It really is a great read.,overall
Hard to stop reading, Gruen spins a wonderful tale with vivid characters.  Even the pitiful elephants have a role, as all sentient being should. But Gruen is never preachy.  She lays out the story for the enjoyment of the reader.  Good juicy book.,overall
isn't pretty - neglect of the elderly, abuse of animals, abuse of humans, slavery, penury, starvation, mental illness, and murder. Authoress Gruen plunks you right down amidst it all. You are really there. And the epilogue is a real shocker (pun intended). Let's just say, Thomas Edison wasn't exactly Saint Thomas.,overall
When Jacob Jankoswki learns of the death of both of his parents in an automobile accident, his grief renders him unable to sit for his final exams at Cornell Vet school and he hops the first train he sees out of town. Fate has intervened, however, and it turns out that the train belongs to a traveling circus, which ends up hiring him on as the show's animal doctor. The year is 1931, jobs are scarce, and, as Jacob quickly discovers, Uncle Al, the show's unforgiving ring master, and August rule the circus with an iron hand. Performers are treated well, but working men often go unpaid or worse, are \red lighted,\ or thrown off the moving train in the dead of night. It is a brutal world, and Jacob walks its fine line between working men and performers. One day Jacob falls in love with Marlena, the show's star attraction and the wife of homicidally paranoid schizophrenic August, and their worlds at the circus will never be the same.This is an excellent and engrossing novel, told from the point of view of Jacob both in 1931 and today, with him at age 93 and in a nursing home, reflecting on past memories. Pull back the tent flap and step right in to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. You will yearn to be sitting in the circus train's boxcar, curled up with a book by the light of a flickering kerosene lantern amidst the folds of big top canvas as you roll on through the night to the next town and the next big show.,overall
Excellently written and completely absorbing. It's one of those rare books that has no part you will want to skim over or read through.The characters and the story linger in your mind long after you finish reading the book. Easy to read, I highly recommend.,overall
Good story line, entertaining, The dont like the circus but this has a great story line that,yes has a circus feel but it has a love story, drama and flash backs into the past. Great book.,overall
I like that it is a true story. It has strong and well-developed characters. If you liked the movie, you will like the book. Movie is truer to the book than many, but the book has more detail, as expected.,overall
One of the best books I have ever read. Truly a great joy to read.  All the woman in my family have read it and we all came away loving the story. I fell in love with Rosie the elephant.,overall
90-ish Jacob Jankowski narrates his story in flashbacks from a nursing home. His days with the circus feel more real and alive to him than his current reality.After his parents are killed in a car accident, Jacob runs out on his vet school exams and joins the circus. Circus life is not always easy, but Jacob has experiences with humans and animals that change his life forever.Gruen brings the Depression-era circus vividly to life, along with its many colorful characters. If Rosie the elephant and Bobo the orangutan don't touch your heart, it's made of stone!Highly recommended!,overall
I had hesitated purchasing this book as I had read mediocre reviews of the movie when it came out.  I was hooked from the first chapter!  The chapters set in the nursing home had me laughing out loud!  Some of the animal cruelty segments were very difficult to read but the book is very well written and almost makes you feel as if you are right there with the circus family!  I have already highly recommended it to friends.,overall
This is a great book.  It has twists and turns and many surprises.  One of those stories I would read again.  There is so much I am sure I missed something.,overall
I LOVED this book and found it nearly impossible to put down!  Buy it today you will not regret it!,overall
This book is an easy read that is highly entertaining and visual.  I loved it so much that I bought it on tape  so that my family could share it.  It truly captivated me.  I highly recommend it if you are looking for a solid, good read.,overall
I loved the time setting and how the author went back and forth from now to then, it really gave you a sense of how the old man felt, it was sweet but sad. I saw the movie too and as always, the book was much better. It's one of the best books I have read in a long time.,overall
Loved the author's notes at the end... her words made the novel that much more personal. Loved the book! Read it!,overall
I absolutely love this book! Sara Gruen does an amazing job of weaving a tale about the journey towards the end of one's life, the beginning of love, tragedy, uncertainty, sadness, happiness, and delightful surprises.,overall
The excellent details of circus life and the story of Jacob were capturing. Enjoyed the change from past to present without confusion.  At the end, wanted to read more of the life of Jacob.  Maybe a sequel?,overall
I read this book for my book club a couple months ago and we unanimously liked it. Animal rights activists may find themselves squirming at times. But it's worth the read. Highly recommended.,overall
A masterpiece, both historically and emotionally accurate. I Highly recommend it.You won't be able to put this one down.,overall
This was the kind of novel that I hated to finish. The characters were so endearing, the story so exciting and heartfelt.  Sara Gruen is a wonderful writer. She weaves memory around a love story filled with action and adventure, using the backdrop of a travelling circus during the Great Depression.  A wonderful trip to another time. I found it very hard to put this novel down.,overall
This book is a must read! I absolutely loved every minute of it. It is different yet keeps you reading. The characters are wonderful and the story is told with a great amount of emotion. Love love love,overall
Reading the back cover of the book did not entice me to read this.  A friend told me I had to read it, however.  It is excellent.  I wasn't sure about it at first but ended up loving it.,overall
Books are entertainment.  There are some that get taught flying lessons, but overall, most manage to accomplish that goal.  Some you enjoy while the book is open and then forget as you close the cover on the last page.  Some may stay with you a day, a week, a month.  These you probably tell your friends about.  Most are interruptible if something else comes along.  The phone rings, your neighbor comes knocking, cat fight in the yard, world peace is declared; you dog-ear the corner, set it aside and get back to it later.And then there is that rare book you open to the first page and several hours later, your butt numb, your joints stiff from inactivity, your eyes misting, your vision blurred, you close the cover on the last page.  That rare book that sucks you in so completely you lose track of time and place.  You look up from the page at your surroundings and feel a momentary confusion.  The morning light that was streaming through your window when you started reading is now afternoon light coming through the door.  That rare book that, as you race mid-way through, you wish with all your heart it would never end.  That rare book you long to jump into, become a part of, live forever in.Water For Elephants by Sara Gruen is such a book.,overall
This is by far an exceptional book.  It gives a glimpse of circus life that you would never know about if you hadn't read this book.  But it is a truly good story with a decent ending for a very old circus man.  It leaves you thinking of the story long after you are done with the book and while reading it, it is a real page turner.,overall
When a friend recommended this book I was hesitant because I normally do not like novels that revolve around history or romance. I honestly read the book to appease my friend, and was blown away by the characters and the storyline. The book was definitely not the boring and corny romance story I expected it to be. I found Water for Elephants to be captivating, humorous, and heartbreaking.The book begins with a young veterinary student who discovers that his parents have been killed in a car accident. He returns home to find that he has been left with nothing and that his parents had put everything at stake for his ivy league education. When they died their home, veterinary practice, and savings were all lost to the bank. Overcome by grief, he is unable to complete his finals and runs away from everything and everyone he knows. At a loss for direction and purpose, he jumps a train in the dead of night hoping to find himself in a strange town where he can start to live again. Instead, he finds himself on a circus train, where he becomes engrossed in a community unlike anything that he has ever experienced. The weeks and months that follow are both his saving grace and his living hell.,overall
What an intriguing story!  From the first gripping lines of the prologue, I was pulled into the world of the traveling circus, a world I had purposefully avoided until now.  Told through the perspective of an elderly man's recollections, this book is full of grit, empathy, and adventure, and is a sharp portrayal of the seedier side of the depression era sideshow life.  The author juxtaposed greed, sloth, abuse, mental illness, and the fascinating circus world of cheap glamour and talented charlatans against the bittersweet remembrances of an old man and his present day frustration with trying to live life more fully at an advanced age.  There is a little surprise at the end that I had not foreseen.  The back of the book describes this work with words like vivid, rich, and riveting.  It is all of those things and more - a great story well told.  Water for elephants is highly recommended.,overall
I think I liked every single page of this book. It was a well-written semi-historical account of circus life and human interaction, but it wasn't over written. Definitely one of the better books I've read. It did move a bit slowly, but it's difficult to notice how slowly a book moves when you read it quickly. I imagine if I had read this book over the stretch of a week or two, it would have been a little less interesting. However, it did motivate me to keep reading, so I doubt I would have wanted to stretch it out that long.,overall
Wonderful and moving. The author has a way of inviting you into this mysterious, misunderstood, hard world where nothing is really as it seems. It is gritty and unattractive, yet passionate and gripping. Loved it.,overall
I wish I had NEVER seen the movie after reading this book. I was beyond excited to know they had done a movie since I absolutely fell in love with this book, until I struggled through it...,overall
Such a good read and hard to put down.  Liked the ending, found it to be a happy possibility.,overall
I thought about these characters when I wasn't reading, that rarely happens. Very enjoyable read.,overall
This was a great adventure and had been engrossed throughout the entire book. Sweet but strong men, some violent and control freaks.,overall
One of my biggest indicators of a well-written book is if I am transported to that world in such a way that I can see, hear, and even smell it. Sara Gruen sweeps a 93 year old Jacob Jankowski quickly into your heart before tossing you into the world of his 23 year old self. We are there to witness the moment in this man's life when the smooth path he is on is up-heaved with the death of his parents and the loss of his future veterinary practice. His new course turns out to be on the tracks and with the belly of the circus.With the help of an old roustabout, Jacob learns the language and hierarchy of the circus, and eventually lands a job as the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth's vet. We learn with our protagonist the dirty reality of day to day life of a traveling circus in 1931. A colorful host of secondary characters help Jacob on his journey, with the most important being Marlena, the show's star equestrian, and her husband, the cruel animal master, August.Jacob and Marlena's paths soon become twisted and intertwined as the fall in love, and try to find their escape from her insane, brutal husband and the circus that they are trapped in serving. Their answer comes in the form of an elephant named Rosie, and a fateful disaster that destroys those holding them back, while free the lovers to their happily ever after.This story comes full circle in the end as 93 year old Jacob finds himself once again at the gates of the big top, and is given a chance to go home once again.,overall
I decided to read Water for Elephants because I discovered that Robert Pattinson is going to star in the movie version of it. As you may or may not know, I am a HUGE fan of Robert Pattinson. I definitely like him more than I should. Robert Pattinson aside, I am so glad I read this book. I did not know what to expect, but it was absolutely amazing!The main character, Jacob, is so easy to like. He has lived an extremely interesting life. In the beginning, he is a veterinarian student who is about to take his final test to become a full-fledged vet. Unfortunately for him, a tragedy claims his parents' lives, and he becomes too emotionally broken to even start the test. He ends up jumping on a train that happens to be a circus train, so he is practically thrown into this world as the circus vet.I really loved this book for so many reasons. One, Jacob is a vet (sort of), which I love because that is what I want to do. You can obviously tell he loves animals. The characters were complex and intriguing. The bad guys like August and Uncle Al had so many levels to them that they were often hard to read. Rosie, the elephant, was probably one of my favorite characters. Even if she is an elephant, she was so funny and smart! She definitely made the story so much better because I could not help but love her.Water for Elephants is an amazing book. Sara Gruen is such a talented writer that it is no wonder I love this book so much. With the action, forbidden love, hard choices, loss, and so much more, Water for Elephants is one of the best books I have ever read. It captivated me from page 1. I absolutely love this book, and it is now one of my favorites.,overall
Absolutely LOOOOOOOOVED this book! I have an old sentimental soul and I got lost in the world created in this novel. I would highly recommend it to a friend!,overall
Jacob Jankowski is ninety-three or ninety and resides in a nursing home, visited once a week by family members.  When a circus comes to town and sets up camp nearby, Jacob remembers his stint on a traveling circus during the Depression.  As a young man, he studied veterinary science at Cornell, but a family tragedy caused him to change his course.  Once enlisted as the circus vet, Jacob meets an array of colorful people and animals, who are by turns, violent, gentle, mercurial and loyal. When he falls in love with the wife of one of his colleagues, trouble arises. resulting in tragedy. However, there is a second act in the senior Jacob's life, as it turns out he is not yet through being part of a circus.This is an unforgettable book that depicts a world that will be unfamiliar to many readers. Those who have enjoyed Ms. Gruen's earlier horse novels will likely enjoy this as well, although it is written ina different style.  A deserved bestseller, \Water For Elephants\ is a heartwarming story and a ripping yarn, as the Brtish might say.,overall
On my list of \Books to Read,\ I finally got around to reading Sarah Gruen's \Water for Elephants\ and found myself up until the wee hours of the morning finishing the last breathtaking page.This is the kind of book that is so well researched and told that it captivates you - much like the circus it portrays - with feats of beauty and astonishment.I really loved this book, and was somewhat disappointed by the movie - which, as always, changes certain aspects of the book and allows for director/artistic interpretation of scenes contrary to my original interpretation. But that's the beauty of books and individual interpretation - they are your own to make as beautiful as you can imagine, guided only by the artistic mastery of the author.I saw that another individual had given this book 1 star - merely for editing on an E-Book version.  Unless every word was morphed and un-readable, I find that slightly harsh to Ms. Gruen.This is a wonderful story, that has moment's similar to the The Notebook and the movie Big Fish.  I recommend it for anyone who enjoys historical fiction and romance.  It is carefully researched and filled with drama, humor, passion and love.,overall
This is a book for anyone who loves to be drawn into a stroy and held there. This is a richly written and warm page turner with characters that come to life. I read it quickly and my only complaint was that I was left wanting more of this beautiful story.,overall
If you are like me, you're wanting to read the book before the movie comes out in a few weeks.  I've heard about this book for months, but I never could bring myself to buy it.  A favorite actor of mine is in the movie, so I finally decided to read it.  I am sorry I waited so long to do so!  It's one of the best books I've ever read.  The author's words are so well-written and descriptive, they paint pictures in your mind.  GET THIS BOOK if you want a heart-warming, and at times, thrilling read!,overall
I saw the movie first and then knew I had to read the book. As expected the book is even better than the movie, amazing detail and unexpected plot twists. Great read!,overall
This is not the type of book that I usually read, but once I started, I couldn't put it down.  The lives that those people lived (if half of this book was true), was truly horrendous.  This was truly a compelling story, and one that I have already recommended to many of my friends!!,overall
This book has it all,an insiteful look at circus life during the depression. a love story, great character studys human and animal. So looking forward to the spring 2011 movie,the lead actors perfectly chosen.,overall
I loved this book.  I could not put it down once I began reading it. Perhaps it's because I'm rapidly approaching the age where I could end up in a nursing home myself, but that part of the book fascinated me. It's from the perspective of a 93-year-old man in a nursing home.  It rang true.  I was touched by the nurse who treated him like a person, who explained things to him, and cried with him when his family failed to show up to take him to the larger-than-life event he had looked forward to throughout the book--the circus.  It made me think back over the experiences with our own parents and wish I could go back and do things differently.The other part of the book, the flashbacks into this man's history were fast-paced and exciting.  I immediately sympathized when, as a young man, he lost his parents and found himself alone in the world, and understood his running away from it all. Maybe I question the believability of one or two points while he traveled with the circus, but not enough that it marred my enjoyment of the book.  I simply took it as an indication of how much things have changed in this country over time. What would not fly now might have at one time. It opened my eyes to how easy it is to become absorbed into any society (even the world of a traveling circus)  and how to survive, a person must abide by rules they might otherwise never consider.  The book showed the higher and baser aspects of human nature, all of which I found easily believable.  The world is filled with people who have differing stories and problems.  We don't all behave the same or believe the same, but we do conform to the ethics of our individual worlds--good or bad.  I believe the author demonstrated that  beautifully.I read some of the other reviews, and was saddened that some people couldn't see past  the imperfections and simply enjoy the different facets of the story.  It's a good one.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good read.,overall
One of the best books I have ever read! Fluid narrative. Great character development. I could not put it down. What a great story. It is a must in any one's collection of great fiction!,overall
WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is like candy for readers.  It was one of two best books I've read in the past year.  In fact, it probably ranks as one of my favorite books of all time.  It was expertly, yet simply, written by Sara Gruen.  The novel tells the story from the perspective of Jacob Jankowski who currently resides in a nursing home.  The story alternates between Jacob's current living situation and the story of his past, how he once worked in a circus during the first part of the 20th century.  The impending visit of a traveling circus next door to the nursing home prompts him to remember the details of his circus life/experiences when he was a young man.Gruen's description of the nursing home, its residents, and its day-to-day activities was spot-on.  Having visited my grandparents on several occasions in their nursing home, I could easily visualize and relate to Jacob's experiences.  It really came to life.You can tell that a lot of research was also put into the circus recollections of Jacob Jankowski.  Gruen delves into circus life in the early 20th century when circuses traveled via train from town to town, and animal welfare and regulations were little more than an afterthought.  I found all of Jankowski's experiences intriguing and actually felt like I was experiencing them right along with him.  The characterizations felt realistic, too, and I could easily distinguish between the many different circus workers, and even some of the more prominent animals.It wasn't until halfway through the novel, though, that I realized how the nursing home is a metaphor for the circus.  Gruen makes subtle comparisons between the animals in the circus and the residents of nursing home.  They're both herded, fed, and prodded.  Jacob even says, \I'm so used to being scolded and herded and managed and handled that I'm no longer sure how to react when someone treats me like a real person.\  So true.  And sad.Now that I've read this fantastic book, I'm very eager to see the forthcoming movie adaptation.  I'd like to say that I'd love to see a sequel to this great tale; however, I think Jacob Jankowski's story has already been told in full in this one well-crafted novel.,overall
I couldn't put this down.  A wonderful story, with rich authentic detail.,overall
This is one of a handful of books I haven't been able to put down easily. Finished in two sittings(!), it's the tale of an old man, reflecting on his youth as a Cornell veterinary school dropout who joins the circus after learning he has no home or family to go back to. Carefully researched, Sarah Gruen takes the reader through a traveling circus from the depression era. Many of the subplots were taken from actual recorded events, adding to the realism of the book. The characters also represented each aspect of the circus; I became concerned for the stage dwarf as much as an old tent setter. The novel also switches from the past time in the circus to the present, where the protagonist reflects on his current state in the nursing home in an often comical fashion, giving a break to the main plot line and building suspense. Highly recommended for those interested in historical novels.,overall
Such a great book. Flash back from the main character's POV. Not my usual genre of book, but absolutely fell in love with this book. I could not put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read. Absolutely delightful!,overall
A joy to read.  It kept me on the edge of my page. The characters were rich, enthralling, sweet, dark, evil, and beautiful.,overall
Wow, what a great story. Wonderful book, audiobook was fantastic! Would recommend listening to the audiobook over reading the book.,overall
Wow! Sara Gruen is a master storyteller. Her words make the often seedy yet oh-so-fascinating world behind the scenes of a legendary circus train seem so real, so here and now. The central figure of Jacob Jankowski is so well written. I am especially taken with the depiction of life in a nursing home with the body of a 93-year-old and the wit and mind of a much much younger man. It gave me a whole new perspective on how sad and depressing life must be like in an institution like that and will make me spend more time getting to know those who find their homes in such a place. But what struck me most was when I read the Afterward in which Ms. Gruen explained the motivation for writing this novel and the incredibly detailed research that she found herself doing just to put pen to paper. Not only is she so very gifted with the ease of writing, but she is very committed to the realism of details. Incredible! She took some really fascinating true stories from some of this country's most storied circuses and rolled them all into one incredible journey. I highly recommed this book to everyone I meet and I will be looking for more of her works to inspire and inform. Do yourself a favor and pick up this book today.,overall
This book was stunning... I just couldn't get sucked into it and almost gave up until a facebook post where someone said it was one of the best books they'd ever read. I decided to give it one more try, and I'm so glad I did. It was amazing!!!,overall
Great biography that touches the soul and causes one to re-evaluate their purpose in life.,overall
I could not put this book down. I absolutely loved it and have passed it on and recommended it to others to read it as well. Although it's a fictional account of a circus story, it was very believable and I was only disappointed in an unrealistic ending. I still give it five stars because everything up to the last page or two was so entertaining.,overall
I highly recommend it.  The story was very entertaining and well written. I enjoyed this book very much. Read it.,overall
This is one of the best books I have read in quite some time. Good and strong story, nicely written. I could not put my kindle down. Thank you Ms.Gruen, I really enjoyed your book and will buy more of your work.,overall
The reviews from \Booklist\ and \Publisher's Weekly\ are a little misleading--the book really is more uplifting and not as depressing as the plot elements they have focused upon.  This story leads the reader into the rich and complex world of traveling circuses, circa 1930's.  The journey of the young man reminded me of Clyde Griffiths in Theodore Dreiser's, \An American Tragedy\, the relationship between Marlena and August reminded me of the dynamics between Sophie and Nathan in William Styron's, \Sophie's Choice\.  But, in spite of these analogies, the book still isn't depressing!  A good summer read, you won't be disappointed.,overall
The setting for this drama was nothing that I was familiar with. It made the story original and interesting.I felt a connection to all the characters.The author made every one seem real and I couldn't wait to find out what happened to them all.This was a great page turner.,overall
I had a vague idea of what this book was about before I read it and I was in for a nice surprise. The author paints a wonderful picture of circus life and life on the road. More than that she created a compelling love story that moved the story along quickly and almost effortlessly. It was easy to get lost in the ups and downs of this world and I had a hard time coming back to reality. This is a definite must read.,overall
Water for Elephants deserves all the hype it has gotten. Terrific story and I could not put it down.,overall
Enjoyed this.Believe a book most anyone would like.Never wanted to run away to a circus but if I did I would join this group of misfits.,overall
If you are looking for a fast reading, really interesting and gripping story with an out of left ending....here it is.Story has all the trappings.....sex, intrigue, murder. Main character is very likeable with a realy love for animals. Villain is a real monster that will make you hate him.Different, and really good!!,overall
This was a really good, enjoyable, authentic, endearing book.  Thoroughly enjoyable read.  One of a kind, leaves you wanting more of the circus on the rails of the depression era. I also love first-person novels that stay on plot and Gruen doesn't disappoint there.I TOTALLY disagree with another reviewer who said Gruen over-anthropomophized and over-romanticized the animals in the story! Hardly. If anything, if Jacob is a vet, we read very little of him doing his job in context of the story.  And anyone who's around animals or has worked with animals can hardly fail to form emotional attachments to them.When I finished WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, I like I felt when I finished reading FRIED GREEN TOMATOES AT THE WHISTLE STOP CAFE and SEABISCUIT.,overall
I had some idea of the content of this book before I started reading, but was extremely impressed with the author's skill in opening the world of the Depression-Era circus, and the fascinating people who populated it.  Her ability to shift between the poignant situation of the aged Jacob, and the youthful enthusiasm and passion of the youthful Jacob made this novel 'work' better than most I've read in years.  The ending did catch me by surprise, and was absolutely delightful in all respects.  I will commend this book to the attention of anyone who wants to look through a window on the past, and the believable people who occupied that world -- told in the words of a very gifted author.,overall
WOW Well worth the 5.00 eBook price. I Laughed, I Cried and I could not put this book down. It was a amazing story that and I read a lot and have never read anything like this. I can only imagine how Hollywood is going to slaughter this movie so you MUST read this book. It is in my Top 5 Favorite Books of all time list!!!,overall
It is the present day. An old man, either 90 or 93 - he can't recall - lives in a desultory, grumpy funk in a generic nursing home, treated like a product, given impersonal but efficient care, and regularly visited by a vaguely attentive, dutifully loving, but clueless family. He is lonely; he misses his wife; he longs for attention from his prolific family, but understands that they have problems of their own. For solace, he relives his early life on a continuous thread - his life as a circus veterinarian for a second-rate travelling show.In alternating chapters, the author, Sara Gruen, takes us from the present to 1931 and back, showing us a rich history of a good young man whose life is changed forever when his parents die in a car crash, leaving him destitute just as he is to stand for his final exams at Cornell. He had hoped to go into practice with his father as a small-town vet; instead, at a total loss, he bolts, jumping a train which turns out to belong to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth (or words to that effect). He is plunged into the colourful, quirky world of the circus, with all its different intensities and personalities; at risk of being summarily thrown off the train, he is reprieved by Uncle Al, the owner/operator/ringleader of the circus when that gentleman learns that Jacob is - for all intents and purposes - a vet, something Uncle Al has coveted for a long time.Jacob falls easily into the life, loving working with the animals, learning to become one of the circus family, and finding an unlikely friend in the dwarf whose living space he shares. Along the way, and almost immediately, he also falls hopelessly in love with the wife of Uncle Al's right-hand man August. Marlena is the woman of the horses, directing her own act with 12 beautiful Arabians in the ring, and her grace and beauty completely captures Jacob. He must tread carefully; her husband, August, is borderline insane and insanely jealous.The old Jacob buries himself in these memories, frets over the static life of the nursing home, and learns to look for one particular nurse who seems to be the only person who really takes an interest in him. She counsels him gently; she brings him food that is just a little better than what he's been getting; and we get a glimpse, through his eyes, of the frustration of the elderly, trapped inside a body that won't cooperate anymore and surrounded by people who aren't interested in his bright former life.This was an absorbing, entertaining book, a complete joy. Well-written, well-researched, it opens a door on a world that most people never thought about and makes the different subjects into real people. It also made me feel empathy toward those in impersonal facilities, who live for a familiar, interested face, and who long to impart to us the lives they led. I could not put this book down. Highly recommended.,overall
I can't believe it took me this long to pick this book up.  What a great story and very well written.  I always enjoy books that go back and forth between past & present, and the author did it brilliantly.The only thing I disliked was reading about the treatment of the animals, but that is to be expected with a circus story.Would definitely recommend this book to a friend.  I'm sure the upcoming move won't do the book justice, but will at the very least draw some new readers.,overall
This is a wonderful book.  Pure entertainment.  This will leave you with a soft spot for the circus, for trains and for vaudville.  We vacationed with a group of friends recently and passed this one around; five of us managed to read it in the eight day vacation....it's that good!,overall
I loved this book.  My best friend recommended it and originally I did not think much of the description of the story.  When I began to read the book though, I was totally absorbed into the story and had a tough time putting the book down.  This is a definite &#34;Must Read&#34;,overall
Beautifully written. Lots of detail and action. Very poignant passages. Worth the time. You won't regret the investment.,overall
I loved this book.  It is very human and lets us see inside the big top and how life was like.  A very good read.,overall
It's been a long time since a novel about circus life has been published, and this excellent book certainly makes up for all of those missing years. It is a well told tale that is, in part, humorous, tragic, romantic and heartbreaking. The book uses the same narrative device as \Little Big Man\, that is, a very old gentleman remembering the exciting and adventurous days of his youth, and the circus he accidentally joined. The characters are extremely well drawn, even the minor ones, and I'm sure that the author spend many days delving into circus lore to get the details correct. Being of Polish descent, I enjoyed the fact that the protagonist was Polish, and I was taken back to my grade school days when a character began reciting the \Our Father\ in Polish! It amazed me that, after all of these years, I could still read and pronounce those words correctly. This is simply a wonderful novel, and I highly recommend it!,overall
It's not often that a book leaves me cheering out loud, but WATER FOR ELEPHANTS did just that.Packed with delightfully-unfolded information about depression-era circuses, this book is more than a history of the big top and most definitely more than a mere boy-meets-girl story.For a young man, the glamor of running away to join a circus isn't really all that glamourous after all. Gruen shows the seedy side of the big top, the desperate times of the depression, the multilayered personalities of performers, roustabouts, owners, and even the animals, and balances it all delicately with the memories of an old man in an assisted living facility.I loved the way the title tied in to the story. No one, apparently, carries water for elephants, since elephants drink far too much. But in our memories - perhaps we all believe we have carried water for our own private elephants.I admit I read it twice in a week - inhaling it the first time, savoring it the second (particularly the ending). Tasty indeed, and five-star all the way.,overall
\Water for Elephants\ is a book that lives up to all the hype. I don't think you will be disappointed by this book. It's a well written, engrossing story.,overall
This is the first book I got from the Kindle Lending library, I read it in two days, fantastically written. Believable Characters, I loved Water for Elephants, I will probably buy it to read again.,overall
After watching the movie (which I liked), my sister gave me the book. I was really excited about reading it, I know it's a bestseller and that I was probably going to like it. I admit, the real reason that made me curious about this story was that Jacob, the protagonist, is a veterinarian, like me.Jacob is a young man who is about to end his studies, when life gives him an awful surprise. His parents are dead, and he is left with nothing. Running from his old life, he jumps into the train of a circus called The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. He is saved from being hurled out of the train only because he's a veterinarian. The circus have a lot of animals, and they need to be taken care of.Jacob is young, innocent and a veterinarian with a big love for animals. Taking care of the animals makes him happy, and that is how he met Marlena. Beautiful, fragile, but married.I really liked this book. I loved how the author described life at the circus. It's obvious she investigated about circus, the people who worked at them, how they function, and their animals.But what I liked more was the writing. The story is told by old Jacob. He's 90 years old, or 93, and his memories about the circus, his wife and his life don't die. He starts narrating the story, but suddenly you realize you are reading young Jacob while being at the circus.Overall, Water for Elephants was a book that grabbed me from the beginning. Although I wanted more emotion between Marlena and Jacob, it's a romantic story, full of action, love for animals and a magnificent circus.,overall
We can read in an author's note that Sara Gruen has studied elephant behavior.  She has more than studied it she has affectingly captured it in Rosie, a large gray elephant and the one hope of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a down at the heels circus trying to make a go of it during the Depression.Now, Rosie wasn't too much of a hope because she was lovable but could not follow any command .  Rosie's only unique characteristic was a seemingly unquenchable thirst for  lemonade.  Her inability to perform was no excuse for the intolerable cruelty visited upon her by August, the callous menagerie director who thought nothing of tossing a lit cigarette into Rosie's open mouth.  He didn't limit his abuse to helpless animals but also mistreated his lovely wife, Marlena.Spellbindingly read by David LeDoux and John Rutledge Jones, Water For Elephants is at its heart the story of three - Jacob, who has lost his parents in a tragic accident, and finds a home with the circus, Marlena and, of course, Rosie.  It's a poignant look at their lives set against an oppressive, sometimes degrading circus world, and a look back at our country during the grueling Depression years.  Most importantly, it's a reminder of the resiliency of human beings and how love can heal.- Gail Cooke,overall
What a great book!  I picked it up at my library after hearing it suggested at my book club.  I didn't want the story to end, but I wanted it to end because it was just so powerful and moving.  By the end I was crying from shock, grief, and sheer happiness.  The author took a subject that I've never thought about and gave it so much life.  I want to know more about circus trains and old time circus shows.  Read it!,overall
I don't write reviews that actually tell you about the book.  The book jacket and other readers do that.  I will tell you that the characters and story are really well developed and you find yourself reacting to them.  Really enjoyed this book.  One of the few pieces of real literature I've read in some time and not at all predictable.,overall
A very unusual book. I couldn't put it down. It gives an insight to circus life in the days when they travelled by train. It is written through the eyes of a young lad who traumatised by the death of his parents was unable to complete his final exam to become a vet and accidentally joins the circus. The characters and the animals are all very real. Some you love and some you hate (never the animals. Anyone who loves circuses and remembers (or would like to know) how they used to be will love this book.,overall
This story is lovely and you cannot put it down. I read every word from cover to cover. There are also authors notes, an interview with Sara Gruen, and questions for book group discussions.Now back to my title for review. So many of you gave the story away you should not rethink your reviews. Thank G-d, I had already chose to read this book when I read Riding Lessons. I had never read one review on this book before I bought it. I wonder what goody Sara has for us next. It will be fun as long as I stay away from reviews!,overall
I picked this up from the library's Best Seller rack with a little doubt about whether I would enjoy it or not.  Was I surprised!!! This is one of the most enjoyable novels I've ever read.  I couldn't put it down.  It contained romance, mystery, history, suspense, comedy, drama, and tragedy all in one story.  I went through a gamut of emotions reading this and thoroughly enjoyed the ending.,overall
He's 90 or 93 he doesn't really remember and it doesn't really matter anyway because according to Jacob's nothing really matters after a few years in an old folks home.  His bitter and sarcastic exterior conceals a deep pain and the certain knowledge that the better years of his life have passed by.  As Citizen Kane says old age is the only disease that no one wants to be cured of.Things weren't always this way Jacob was young once until an unfortunate series of circumstances ended his hopes of being a vet forever.  He is then taken on a journey across the country with a circus it is a fun little book and well worse the trip.  The characters have life and everything that fictional characters should have.  You'll find it to be so good that even though you can see the ending coming from three miles away you will not even care.Overall-It is rare that I run across a book this good,overall
This book stays with you long after reading it.  I couldn't have been much better than this.,overall
My wife comes from a circus background going back to her grandfather. She read it, her mother amd father read it too. The verdict? Ms. Gruen is spot on. For me, the layman, it was a great read and, well researched and totally believable. Other than that I can't improve on what everyone has said.,overall
Very good reading and I could not put my Kindle down.  Good insight into circus life.  Will have to research for other books from this author.,overall
What an enjoyable book to read and I learned about the circus.  Very funny and it kept my attention.  I have passed this around to all of my friends.  Great read!,overall
Although this is not my typical genre, I was completely taken with this novel. I found it especially fascinating that so much of this book was based on actual circus history. Thank you, Ms. Gruen for the incredible research on train circuses and depression-era life.,overall
Loved the book, couldn't put it down! I will recommend it to friends, it will be difficult to watch the movie and not nit pick the details.,overall
I couldn't put it down and was sad when it was over. I don't think I'll even see the movie because it would HAVE to be a let-down!,overall
I could not have loved it more. Water for Elephants is one of those wonderful novels that has an interesting setting, but it doesn't let the setting take over the story. It is a novel about the people in that place, and the people of Benzini's circus took over my mind and stay with me still.Jacob begins Water for Elephants alone. Orphaned by his immigrant parents, he is weeks away from his Cornell graduation, but he simply cannot return to the life he has known. He jumps aboard a moving train-the train carrying the Benzini circus to its next production. No one on the circus cares that Jacob didn't finish his final exams. The diploma, he is told, \is just a piece of paper, and nobody here gives a damn about that. You're on a show now. The rules are different.\In fact, the circus seems to have no rules at all. Jacob somehow finds other kind souls among the misfits, and these people work together to protect themselves and the animals. The villians-Uncle Al and August-are well described and three-dimensional. You understand why they behave the way they do. These villians are not cookie-cutter images, and their real-world sensibilities make them even more frightening.,overall
As most previous reviewers have said, this is a rich tale of circus life in the '30's. The protaganist, Jacob, is appealing with personality and real human emotion. I feel the author Ms. Gruen has well-researched everything-circus in writing this book.I felt while reading this book I was actually seeing what transpired in my mind's eye-I could see the rough characters come alive and could smell the sawdust, cookin grease, animals and popcorn. I felt what the characters felt when they fell upon hard times. This book also opened my eyes regarding how a rough slice of life a small circus can be.Bring on the circus parade!,overall
I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The remembrances of an old man of his time in a piece of Americana, the travelling circus. Sara Gruen makes us feel the excitement of the Big Top, the pain, sadness and joy of the people in it, and conveys the dire circumstances of the Great Depression so you can almost taste the dust. I wanted to hurt some of the characters and hug others. The ending is divine.,overall
I loved this book, very entertaining, easy to follow, enjoyed this book and can't wait to see the movie. I want to read more of her books.,overall
Very well-written story with a realistic look at the life of traveling circuses in the '30's and '40's. Also, some insightful thoughts on the process of aging and how we treat elderly folks. Very enjoyable--couldn't put it down.,overall
I had heard of this book for some time and had always wanted to read it - when I saw it available for Prime members I had to download it! What a great story and very well written. I would recommend it to anyone.,overall
I usually don't read fiction, but this kept popping up as a suggestion for me.  I really enjoyed it.  Great writing and great story.,overall
Water for Elephants is about an old man at the end of his days reflecting upon his life and the events that lead him to run away and join the circus right before he finishes college.  His story goes back and forth between his modern day stay at a nursing home and his days in his early 20s during the Great Depression traveling around the country with the Great Benzini Brothers Circus.Sara Gruen does a phenomenal job of painting a vivid portrait of Depression era America and of the end of the golden age of circus life in the USA.  The Photos that head each chapter are fun little bonuses that let you see the actual performers of this time as well as some of the settings in which the book takes place.The characters come to life and are vivid portrayals of heroes and villians.  The relationships formed amongst all the characters are memorable and keep you wanting more.  A page turner that does a good job of keeping you interested by flipping back and forth between past and present.5 star recommendation.,overall
The book was very interesting because of the time difference from young to old man.  The ending was great.  Not expected.,overall
This book is simply wonderful. A mixture of humor and  Grace. It will make you laugh cry. It uses captivating language that makes you feel like you're really in the circus. A wonderful read I'd recommend to everyone.,overall
Very, very good novel.  It was such a moving story, and tugged at my heartstrings, and kept me on the edge of my seat.,overall
A compelling story, set in Depression-era circus train history.  The brutality beneath the illusion of the show's spectacle drives the action with a high level of suspense.  You'll be tempted to rip through it in a single session.,overall
This will be short and sweet. I'm normally and action story reader, biographies, business literature and everything by Cormack McCarthy. This is far from the type of book I would give a read. I gave this a try because it was an inexpensive Kindle best seller and loved it. Great love story, circus story and character development. The best part is the happing ending.If you have read Cormack McCarthy you know you need a happy ending from time to time.,overall
i loved this book. the way the author captures the essence of Jacob in his later years as well as his youth. the novel ignites your senses and awakens the soul. i loved it!,overall
Loved the book. Kept me interested the whole time. Could never see the movie after reading this....couldn't watch the animal stuff. Hard enough to read about the animals...can't imagine watching it. This is a must read on my list.,overall
I bought this for a Reddit gift exchange.  However I have read this book and it's really engrossing.  Highly recommend!,overall
This book was so well researched, that you are transported effortlessly  back in time with Jacob .  Upon learning that most of the incidents in the book are true, just makes this already incredible book all the more awe inspiring. It is impossible not to get caught up in Jacob's life with the circus.  The characters he encounters during his circus days are so real sometimes you think you can actually smell them, but it's his relationship with the animals, especially Rosie the elephant, that particularly touch your heart.  You won't easily forget Rosie and you'll be glad when Jacob can't either.  There is nothing more satisfying than when you finish a book and you feel like you also were part of the adventure.  I am so glad I was packed and ready.,overall
Ms. Gruen has crafted an intriguing plot with complex, well-rounded characters. She's done her research on life in the circus in the early 20th century, and it shows in her beautifully textured scenes. The love triangle was a nice bonus. Water For Elephants captivated me from beginning to end.,overall
I was apprehensive about reading this book since I watched the movie first. I didn't want to compare and then end up with mixed feelings. I'm so happy that I did watch the movie first because I feel I had a better view of the books layout. The story kept me on the edge of my seat even though I had expectations for the events outcomes. I love that the story of Jacob was related to the bible and I commend the author for that. Amazing book. I love the feeling after reading an outstanding  book and this is surely one of them. Excellent job.,overall
Just as great as the movie..... a must read! Would gladly read it again any chance I get. Great job!,overall
I am certain that there are [still] those out there who, like me, had not yet read this novel because it centers around a circus.  Do yourselves a favor, like me, and take this excellent journey with this gifted author.  Water for Elephants, by Sara Gruen, is a very moving story about relationships and family.  When Jacob Jankowski loses his family, he actually joins the circus.  Not because he wanted to, but because it presented itself.  Fortuantely, Jacob was studying to become a veterinarian and the circus was full of animals.  The story is told from the perspective of Jacob as an elderly man and Jacob as a young man.The relationships that Jacob forms during this excellent novel form the corserstone of the story.  I found myself caring about a grouchy dwarf and his 3-legged dog, as well as an elephant, and a cast of numerous colorful characters.  The evocative descriptions of the circus itself - the Benzini Brothers; a wannabee Ringling Brothers - during the Depression; actually put you on a railcar with the smell of dust all around you.  This is certainly no glamorous lifestyle, and Gruen does an exceptional job of providing vivid imagery.  The menagerie that Jacob helps care for are an important piece of this wide ranging cast that features individuals that are easy to hate and aome that are easy to love.  Jacob meets Marlena, who is married to the evil August, and the relationships that ensue become increasingly complicated.I now know more about circuses that I ever knew I wanted to.  I am glad that I do, because the learning was all part of the great fun to be had here.  This is a very entertaining and compelling book.  I could not read it fast enough, yet I felt myself wanting to slow down to enjoy it all the more.  I rate this a highly recommended 5 stars.  Enjoy!,overall
I read a lot of nonfiction and most of the fiction I read is mysteries, instead of \literature\ novels. So when \Water For Elephants\ was loaned to me with a recommendation, I put off reading it. The movie, which I didn't see, got underwhelming reviews, which made me postpone it further. I think I read two new mysteries before finally picking up this book.And then was I surprised.  I loved it! It is imaginative and takes me into the wonderfully described world of a 1930's third-rate train (traveling) circus. If this world seems a little grungy, I remind myself that at the beginning of the 1930's, only 10% of rural homes had electricity for hot water heaters.  Animal rights?  Nonexistent. Workers' rights? Taking its first baby steps.  Occupational safety - don't make me laugh.  Bigotry?  How can fiction be worse than the truth. And over it all, the Great Depression, with it's unrelenting desperation.And these are illustrated in a heckofa story. The plot doesn't just advance, it gallops, it whoops. It has romance, but not implausible romance. Jacob Jankowski is the protagonist, telling the story, with a great last-minute twist, in flashbacks that I thought were handled well. As a matter of fact, the only part of the story that was too unrealistic for me was Jacob's rush to run away from all he knew - to literally, though unintentionally, run away to join the circus. And there he meets Marlena, a circus star with her trained horse team, and Augustus, her equal parts charismatic and brutal husband.I very much recommend this novel. I'm going to have to buy my own copy!,overall
Even people who say \I only read nonfiction\ can enjoy this entertaining novel, which is rich with fascinating details about life in a traveling circus during Prohibition and the Depression. For example, circus members stocked up on booze in Canada and sneaked it across the border into the US  by storing it in the middle of the train car carrying camels, because camels spit, and customs agents didn't want to mingle with them. Against an unusual background, the fictional characters (humans and other animals) weave a story that keeps readers turning the pages.,overall
There is a reason this book is so popular. Not only is a swift-moving adventure, a historical fiction, but it's a a love story about life. And, Sarah Gruen is extremely adept at vividly describing the interior life -- not only of the circus and circus life she so carefully researched but also the interior, psychological experience of her characters, including Jacob, the lead character -- even as an old man. She enters into his experience so deeply that it is impossible as a reader, not to as well! You see the nursing home, the circus, the animals, the rough competition, and the connection.Sarah Gruen has created a book which transcends the circus, and highlights the importance of life and living, no matter how old we are.This is indeed summer reading, and one of the best books I've read all year.,overall
I love this novel. I started reading a printed version, but I had a hard time distinguishing character voices as it was not always marked. And then there were alternating \young\ and then \old\ point of view chapters. Before giving up (because I have the same type of challenge when I read Amy Tan novels), I switched to the audio \book on tape\ and LOVED the book. One of the best novels I've read. And the voice-over talent who read the audio version is a very, very good storyteller.,overall
There is a reason that this book has so many 5 star reviews...I avoided reading this for a while because I didn't think that I'd be interested in novel set in a circus during the depression, but I finally picked it up after yet another person told me how good it was.  I'm so glad that I did!  It really is the best thing that I've read in a long time.  I quickly became engrossed and could not put it down.  Do yourself a favor and give it a try, you will not be disappointed. Oh, and I LOVED the ending!,overall
This book is one of the best books I've read in a long while.  It spoke to me on so many levels!  It made me laugh, it made me cry, it held me captive from cover to cover!  This Author really did her homework, and it shows in her details and imagery she paints for you.  If you say \I saw the movie, it wasn't all that\...well then, you need to forget everything you saw or heard on the silver screen, and pick up the novel!  Everyone knows Novels are ALWAYS better than the movie!  This one, especially.  When I read this book, I would laugh out loud and my Boyfriend (who is NOT a \reader\) would say, \What's so funny\ and I'd tell him a snippet about what I was reading....and before long, he and his 15 year old son were reading it right after me!I enjoyed it very much, and I believe you will too, or I wouldn't recommend it!Sincerely.Heather Lynn Osting - Author[...],overall
I had no or low expectations about this book. I didn't know anything about the plot. It was on the bestseller lists, which doesn't necessarily make it a good book, but I was a little intrigued about all the peripheral hubbub about it. If I had known this book really had to do with circuses (That's not a plot spoiler.), I don't know if I would've started this book. I'm so glad I took the chance. I found it just like a steam engine (read the book); it took a little bit of effort to get rolling, but once it started it just kept picking up speed and going and going and I kept waiting for it to slow, but it didn't. I was amazed that someone actually wrote this story, it was so good. I read it fast and furiously and tensely anticipating what was coming next. I also really appreciated the \discussion\ with the novelist after the novel itself. I enjoyed her explanations. Kudos to Sara Gruen.,overall
A lovely easy book to read. Good story. Makes one think about how we treat our elderly and would we want to be set aside like this. Like happy endings too!,overall
Great read , very hard to put down, great insight into circus life at the time.looking forward to seeing the movie,overall
Wonderful book.I learned more about life in the circus than I ever thought.Well written,and hope to read all of her books soon.It deserved to be on the NY Times best seller list.,overall
In this day and age, there are few books that I love - but Water for Elephants is one of the best books I have read this year. The story is told from an old man in a retirement home reflecting on his life as a circus veterinarian. Not only is the fictional story intriguing, the history of circus life in the 1930s is riveting in this book.,overall
Well written and entertaining.  Good research on subject area and then wonderful character studies.  I love books that keep me eagerly reading to \see what happens next.\  Loved her moving from present to past.,overall
I wound up enjoying the book tremendously, more than I expected to when I started.The story starts out slowly, but subtly draws you in until you are intrigued as to what's going to happen next. The world of circuses, at least to me, was completely unknown - so I couldn't predict what was coming. I was surprised at what horrible conditions both the people and the animlas endured on \train circuses\ of the 1920s-1940s. If you're looking for a happy \magical\ story about running away to join the circus, this isn't it.The character development is limited, as it is written in the first person. My favorite character was Rosie the elephant - because the narrator clearly loves her and therefore you love her.Apparently Gruen did vast research on the train circuses - making her use of jargon, lore and the incorporating of actual stories the core of the novel.As far as I can remember, this is the first time I read a book that provides insight from the perspective of an old person living in a nursing home or assisted living facility. Jacob's frustration at his body failing him and of people making decisions for him and treating him like a child, along with feelings of being abandoned and useless really got to me and were gently and movingly written.The magic comes in the highly improbable, yet tremendously satisfying ending.I definitely recommend the book.,overall
I didn't want to start this book because I'm an animal lover,& I heard some parts were too hard to read.  They are tough, but the book is worth reading.,overall
just loved the story line .  Brought back good memories of going to the circus as a child. It was really great to get a peek at the behind the scenes lives of the Big Top.  A very entertaining book,overall
I couldn't put it down. I love, love, love this beautiful novel. You will never look at a circus or an elephant the same. Sara Gruen's illustration of memory is a very special thing. This novel gives life to spectacular people you come to love and hate, but moreso miss when you've turned the last page.,overall
I TRULY ENJOYED THIS COMPASSIONATE PAGE TURNER.  THE BOOK GIVES THE READER A WEALTH OF INTERESTING CIRCUS FACTS AND HISTORY.  I AM RECOMMENDING IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS.,overall
A ninety--or is it ninety-three?--year-old man recalls his days as a circus veternarian.  Murder, Romance, Intrigue and all the stuff of Trains, Depression and Prohibition give this novel sizzle.  Eleven and a half hours on ten CD's and worth every second of it.  Don't miss this one.,overall
I absolutely loved this book!  The voices of the characters were so well written.  I could \hear\ the booming and sad voice of older Jacob and the passionate voice of young Jacob.  They really came to life for me.  A great read!,overall
If you ever dreamed of running away to join the circus, this is a must read. A deep look into the mysterious world...,overall
Excellent read! Ms. Gruen masters character and plot with beautiful prose. I remained captivated and found myself caring for the diverse cast.  Ms. Gruen successfully evokes a sense of the times, the desperate nature of survival during the Depression, as well as one's attempt to salvage one's sense of self as age betrays the body.  The storyline is suspenseful, true to period, and woven through with a touch of romance.  The setting is gritty and evokes the reality of Circus life on the road and  the behind-the-scenes work required to attain the magical world the public craves.  Well done!,overall
I thoroughly enjoyed this book and couldn't wait to share it with others. All of my friends who've read it, love it as well. As you can tell from the near 5 star consensus from reviewers, this is a wonderful book, so I don't really need to go into a long drawn out review, but I will say that I loved the rich, interesting characters who felt like old friends by the end of the book and the story was engrossing and lovely - a true love story between lovers, between friends and between man and beast. And the total immersion into another world and time was just a bonus. You can't go wrong with this book!,overall
Water for Elephants is a story about an old man's recollection of his days working for the circus, and the bizzare array of characters circus work attacts.  The setting transitions between the wild memories of working as a veterinarian for a travelling circus, set in the 1930s, and the protagonist's present life in a home for the elderly, lonely and unappreciated.  Themes of the book include romance, good vs evil, depression era desperation, and life in old age.The main character is a well studied near-graduate from an Ivy league school who loses everything after a catastrophe and feels he must run away and happens upon a circus train. He ends up working in very rough conditions to survive, and struggles with a love triangle that puts his life in peril.My personal affection for the book lies in the brutal conditions desperate people will endure, particularly for those who feel they have no place to go, as some of these characters do.  I'm also very fond of the contrast of how the elderly protagonist struggles with trivial tasks, like wanting to eat a crisp apple, while his younger self survived through such turbulent times.  Finally, the layout of the story, in which some details are revealed out of order through the time-transitions, enables the reader to piece certain details together before the main narrative gets to it feels like a device out of the movie Pulp Fiction (in a good way).This novel is written based off of actual and anecdotal incidents of circus life (as per the interview with the author contained in the back of the book).  The historical basis, however, is unnecessary to appreciate the vivid story but definitely made me appreciate the author's research to include tidbits of American history that might otherwise be lost.  I found this novel to be the most compelling book I have ever read and literally lost hours of sleep over it.,overall
I caught a review of this book on NPR.I usually am disappointed in books by female authors, but the only thing that bothered me about this book was that it ended. I will keep a more open mind henceforth. I haven't seen the other reviews but can't see how anyone could give this title less than a four. I enjoyed it from start to finish.Am now going to see which of Ms. Gruen's books I want to read next.Well done!,overall
I got this on the Kindle when it went on sale. I'm so glad I did. What a wonderfully researched book. The details are amazing and the story is both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time. I had never heard of this book until the movie came out, which looks a bit \chick-flick'ish\ to me but the book definitely is not. I have not seen the movie yet (waiting for the DVD) but I am anxious to see if its true to the book.I think people of all genres will like this book. I normally read paranomal fiction but I really loved this book. My mom usually reads non-fiction girly books and she loved it. I even have my husband reading it now. So by all means, get this book!,overall
Really enjoyed this novel. It kept you intriqued with what would happen next. Was not just about Tent Circus life it was mystery, love story and human rights all in one. Highly recommend.,overall
I'm not going to go into a synopsis of 'Water for Elephants' as it's been given so many times already. I just want to say how much I enjoyed this book. I finished it in 3 nights and now actually regret having finished it so quickly. This is one of the few books that I feel I have to re-read. I cannot recommend this enough. You won't regret it. I will certainly be reading everything written by Sara Gruen.,overall
This is a great book - well written, interesting, and I really liked it.  The story was pretty sad, though, so don't read it when you're &#34;down&#34;!,overall
Jacob Jankowski recounts the wonderful time he spent with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. During the Great Depression, his parents are killed and Jacob, now penniless, has to leave vet school. He learns the ins and outs of circus life, falls in love with a beautiful horse rider and becomes attached to Rosie, the elephant who responds to Polish commands.,overall
While this book required significant research about the circus, I relished the insightful development of the old man in a nursing home.  It caused me to reflect on aspects of elder care that we don't know or rarely consider.  I read a novel occasionally between my favorite genre of the moment in non-fiction.  This fit the bill.  I couldn't wait to return to it when my reading was interrupted.  A lovely story and welcomed page turner.,overall
Water For Elephants is an excellent novel depicting railroad circus life during the early part of the 20th century.  The author, Sara Gauen researched boxcar circuses before writing Water, the societal environment of the depression, attitudes toward circus workers by owners, treatment of the animals in the menageries and how they were obtained during the depression era then rapped everything into the lives of her main characters, add to this the breaking of the sexual mores frowned on by society, mix, and you have a recipe that makes for good reading.  The best thing about Water is the telling of the story by Jacob Jankowski, who is a 90 or 93 year old Vet depending on how you look at it, now confined in a residential nursing home and looking back into his past. Heads up folks Water for Elephants is coming out as a movie soon and I am looking forward to seeing it.,overall
I totally enjoyed this book.  The characters were well developed, the history was good and I love that it was told from this old man's point of view.  The ending was priceless.  The movie was disappointing compared to the novel.,overall
I found Water for Elephants to be entertaining and educational.  I really cared for the characters and, while I wanted to get to the end to confirm something I thought (it was confirmed), I DIDN'T want to get to the end, because that meant I wouldn't be reading about the characters anymore - BUT, I am carrying them with me - and isn't that what a good book does?I highly recommend this book.,overall
I have always read a lot and since I got the Kindle, I have been reading all the time.  I would have given this book 10 stars if there were a choice for that.  It is easily the BEST book I read in 2010!!,overall
I can't believe it took me so long to read this book. Its a great quick read. I will definitely look for more books by this author. Love the style!,overall
I first heard about this novel in an e-mail from my Mom to my brothers and me.  I asked a co-worker about it.  She'd just finished about it and also raved about it.I just finished it.  What a story.  Very touching.  Very real.  The end is just phenomenal and not what I expected.Read it!,overall
This is an incredible story - how many of us say we want to run away and start over but not many of us actually do.  This wonderful story of the circus life and difficulties faced where everyone has their place.  Truly an unforgetable story of courage and hope.,overall
Pleasantly surprised to enjoy this book as much as I did. I saw the movie first and the book is so much better.,overall
What a great adventure...one feels like they are rightbeside the believable characters under the big tent.  Thisbook has some of the most memorable characters and oneof the wittiest and most satisfying story-lines I have evercome across.  Treat yourself to a great one...read this book!,overall
This is one of those books that I read because I loved the movie first. So, I was quite surprised when I read how the book begins - with the murder of one of the main characters. When I further realized that August does not own the Benzini Brothers, I began to see the movie as its own story separate from the book.Jacob is by far the most interesting character of the book, especially since he tells the story as an old man in a nursing home - and has the wisdom and experience to go with his age. His emotions are infectious and I longed to sit down with him and listen to all of his stories in person way before I finished the book.August is the kind of villain that is confusing in his evil deeds - he has schizophrenia - which makes it somewhat unfair to dislike him so much. His irrational behavior has been exploited for the almighty dollar by Uncle Al - but the real villain tends to fade into the background.Marlena is beautiful to the point of angelic, very little of what she does can be considered wrong in any way, as she is a victim struggling for freedom for most of the book. She approaches August's mood swings with the same caution due a wild animal, and remains faithful to him despite her personal feelings, and does not leave until he first betrays her. Considering how women today will leave their husbands for any reason, I admire her strong morals.The background is set during the Great Depression, which made for many intense situations as the circus struggled to profit, as well as the survival of the cast of characters. Though I studied this period in American history, the direct experience gave me a clearer idea of the desperation of people alive during this time - how easily morals could be put on hold for the sake of another mouthful of food or another coin in the pocket. So many men of the circus would work without pay for the promise of another meal and unending hope that life could still improve.Rosie, the elephant, is also one of the most fascinating characters in the book. She proved to be only one example of how animals were exploited to the point of cruelty for profit. I could not help wondering where the animal activists were.Needless to say, this book sparked many conversations and inspired many moments of personal contemplation for me. I loved this book, and I highly recommend it.,overall
I read Water For Elephants for the second time on Kindle and it was just as exciting as the first time I read it. The book is like being right there at a Barnum and Bailey circus with popcorn and peanuts.  The character, Marlena, was so real, accepting her role as the abused woman and then finally escaping the tyrant she had married.  All of the characters seemed to come to life there on the page.  I thoroughly enjoyed all the scenes. And in the end, when the animals were stampeding, it was interesting to learn that the circus band struck up a particular march to alert the circus performers to take cover or escape.  An excellent read.,overall
This book is AMAZING!  I will not rewrite a review that over 1000 people have written. except to say, that yes, this novel is amazing.,overall
Jacob Jankowski, the main character, is a 90 or 93 year old man in a nursing home and he tells the story of how he wound up joining a circus in his early 20's.  His parents are both killed in a car accident and finds out that his parents have mortaged everything to pay for his tuition at Cornell Vet school.  Figuring that he is unable to continue his education and he jumps on a train in the middle of the night running away from everything he had known.  The train that he winds up on is a circus train.He befriends several individuals and winds up working for the outfit.  One particular person is a married woman named Marlena.  Jacob's boss is Marlena's husband, August.  August is a bit off mentally to say the least.One of the most remarkable and memorable characters in the book is an elephant that the circus aquired named Rosie.  When she is first aquired August believes she is dumbest animal on earth because she would not do anything that they tried to get her to do.  Because of this August beats Rosie on a regulart basis until Jacob by accident discovers that she only understands commands given to her in Polish.  After that discovery Rosie is the star of the show alongside of Marlena.Things don't stay rosy for long.  August has more fits, ex circus employee's who were thrown off the train catch up, and performers get sick and tired of what has been happening.  It all comes together in a pretty horrific, yet kind of an amusing scene in the end.Not only did I enjoy the story of Jacob's circus days, but I also enjoyed Jacob's narration about getting old.  It really makes you think about how we treat the elderly and how we should be treating them.,overall
This book was slow to start but once I got into it I could not put it down.  It twisted and turned all over the place.  It was such a relief despite some of the more depressing points that it had a great happy ending.  The author did a great job giving Rosie the elephant human characteristics.  I liked that it was told from the point of view of an older man looking back.  Even his ending to the story was an amazing one.  I would definantly recommend this book to a friend.,overall
If you're an middle-aged old fart like me, this book might be too much for you. It was nearly overwhelming for me, and it invaded my dreams over the few nights in which I read it. Nonetheless, it's an excellent read. A rending read. A compelling read. Moreover, you might think the author knows you, and is telling a version of your life's story if you, like me, are a middle-aged old fart.,overall
I had no clue what to expect when picking this book up but I have to say it was one of the better reads I've had in a long time.,overall
This book was such a great love story with a very different backdrop.  I loved learning about the circus life.,overall
Water For Elephants, written by Sara Gruen, is a book told as a memoir by a fictional ninety-something old man about his time with the circus as a young man. This experience matured him and forever changed the direction of his life.This book is charming. I could relate to the characters and understand their motivations easily. I enjoyed reading it and have re-read it several times. I highly recommend it to everyone. (Should be at parents discretion as there are some adult themes. Probably best for those over thirteen.),overall
Very good book could hardly put it down. Have the movie will now watch it. Give it a 5 star,overall
This is a wonderful book made better by excellent readers.Jacob Jankowski joins the circus as a young man after the death of his parents.  This was during the depression when many were willing to work for little more than regular meals.  Sara Gruen tells the story of a traveling circus with a surety that makes it hard to believe she has never experienced the cruelty, hard times and camaraderie of circus life.  Even more amazing, the story is told from the perspective of Jacob as a 93 year old man forgotten in a nursing home.There are two readers, one for the young Jacob and one for the old, and both are a true pleasure to listen to.,overall
Yes it has its dark moments.  And yes it can be disturbing.  And that means the author did the job right.The book follows the life that was not an easy one and is not the perfect sunset of old age and conveys it all in the context of a world that most people do not know the in and outs about, the circus, but at the same time which is something we all have dreamed about.  If not dreamed about, at least were enamored with when we were young.As others said, I could not put this book down and lost a bit of sleep turning a few extra pages further in the evening.  But it was worth it.,overall
Vividly written. This novel will stick with you.. the author manages to capture humanity from all walks of life, even going so far as to describe the animals in a humanly way (even though in reality they may be the most human of all.,overall
I loved reading this as I had been taken to a circus a lot as a little girl in NE Illinois and as an adult I worked in 8 different nursing homes. It was wonderful seeing it from the patient's eyes and reading his story. I remember many a story told by patients. One was an old silent movie star! I wonder if Sara Gruen had any nursing home experiance as she nailed it including the caring and non caring type of people that work there and why some of the patients may be grumpy. The view of the circus behind the scenes was a fantastic story!,overall
In  dismal times .  the  era 1930---the story unfolds with interest,and  meaning  and deep reflection of the main character who is now in a nursing home telling this story.A unique plot\ The circus\ , sure leads to imagination and wonder of the  people and circumstances of that era and  their  transient life  styles .  You can taste the vulnerablity of the main character. You can feel his love and applaud his decency.the author does a great job of depicting his image and feeding him throughout the book. I began to see the dirt under his nails and visioned his unkept state, yet, I liked him . the protagonst was well depicted-the author had me on the edge of my seat.  And Rosie, was described so well I felt her breath on my face and the breeze of her ears flapping.After 350 pages with  no frills - -the entire book takes place on a circus train and  the empty lots where the  circus acts  takes place--it behooved me that the book remained a real page turner . It was well written and held my interest. I recommend it to all audiences.,overall
One of those books that I didn't want to end.  The first chapters pull you in quickly.  The history of the circus is absolutely fabulous.  And Sara Gruen's handling of the main character is awesome.  You see life through his eyes as a young man and as an elderly person.  Fascinating.  Don't miss it.,overall
wanted to read the book too -loaded it into my kindle too for those nights when I can't sleep and there are a lot of those,overall
Loved the story and the time period.  Liked the book so much I wanted to see the movie.  Hard to put down!,overall
Boy runs away to the circus, then does it again in his old age.  Lots of adventure for him.  Warm fuzzies.,overall
Saw the movie first and enjoyed the book more than the movie. Very entertaining and well written. I have recommended it to others.,overall
Love Love Love this book!!!  I think the story is wonderful.  If you are an animal lover, you will definitely enjoy this book.  It is also a love story with the main character falling in love not only with a woman, but I think with the animals.  It is a story of friendships and a story of a man at the end of his days looking back and maybe finding that his days are not over.  And I think I love Rosie!,overall
Another book for this summer in the hammock.  I am looking forward to it.  Saw the movie now I will see how accurate they were and how close they followed the book,overall
This was such a well done novel.  If you are looking for something different, something entertaining, and unique....then you have found it!  This story follows the life of a young man that joins the circus.  It has themes of coming of age, adventure, abuse, courage, love, and nostalgia.  This will truly stand out as one of my favorite books.  The author did a wonderful job.  This novel is MUCH recommended.,overall
After I finally got a chance to read this book I couldn't put it down.  Outrageous, fun, and spellbinding, this book will leave you wanting more.  Shame on Sara for not writing another 200 pages!  This glimpse into the 1930's was amazing.  Very well researched!,overall
Water for Elephants\A Novel, Written By Sara GruenBook Review by Jay GilbertsonWho, in their right mind, doesn't like the circus? If you answered \yes,\ then this book is for you. If you answered \no\ then this book is for you too. There is something for everyone in this tremendously well-researched novel of schizophrenic madmen, a possible murderer in pink sequins and a towering heroine who happens to be addicted to lemonade. What could be more fun?A depression-era circus can be the best place to be if you're Jacob Jankowski and you just buried your parents, found out they mortgaged everything they owned to send you off to veterinary college and ultimately you had nothing left to lose.Some of the central themes of this page-turner are to follow your instincts, stay true to what you believe in and try to survive no matter what. It's the what part that kept me flying through the book. The story shifts back and forth from Jacob at ninety (or ninety-three--he's not sure) to his incredible life on the train with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show On Earth--the circus! By incredible, I mean that there is a constant fear-factor woven underneath every nuance, every situation is rubbed raw in not ever being entirely sure of just what the future holds, or even if Jacob has one. That dread is dolled out in buckets-full by the head honcho of Benzini Brothers--Uncle Al--who can have you \red-lighted\ (tossed off the train) for any number of indiscretions, or simply to lesson the load. The incredible part is that, in the end, Jacob not only manages to become the circus veterinarian, he also gets the girl, a bereaved dog, one elephant (Rosie) and eleven horses. Who could ask for more, you ask? Jacob Jankowski, that's who.Then there are the animals. A team of \Liberty\ horses, lions and zebras and llamas, giraffes, chimps, panthers, and Rosie--the elephant--the Polish elephant no less. The elephant that, like all elephants, drinks far more water than anyone could ever imagine carrying, which is one of many parables in this fast-paced tale.Did I mention the train? Benzini Brothers traveled exclusively by steam-train. The train becomes a powerful force that literally grabs up entire, failing circuses in its path and absorbs them like the little fish being eaten by the bigger one.Think shark.Uncle Al is a \take no prisoners\ kind of fellow, unless he can get you for a song. Then he owns your soul.The secondary story line, that of old Jacob looking back on his days with the circus, added a depth to this novel rarely seen in most modern literature. He may not know his exact age, but there is a spark of life in him not quite ready to waste away in the nursing home that has become his prison. Then a circus comes to town and begins to set up shop right next door to the nursing home. It's an opportunity that Jacob simply can't resist.You won't believe what happens next...,overall
Yes, I know the ending seemed a little farfetched, but I LOVED it...and the rest of the book too. Being ignorant about the behind the scenes drama and actions of a circus, Sara Gruen educated me with her well-researched Water for Elephants. The novel was informative and well, graphic at times, and I'll never again enter the big top without feeling some compassion for the roustabouts, the performers, and the animals...especially the elephants. Ah, Rosie. Silver Star too.In addition to educating her readers about the traveling circus life of a bygone era, Gruen also tells a vivid and believable tale about a vet student who, because of a \cruel twist of fate,\ runs away to join the circus. Although the primary story revolves around Jacob and Marlena, the author does a fabulous job of character development as she describes Camel, August, Uncle Al, and other assorted circus folks in a story of love, cruelty, sadness, grief, and triumph.About that ending, I still think it's awesome and quite believable, especially for someone like Jacob who lived his life to the fullest. Maybe there's a lesson in that for all of us.,overall
I liked it because the characters were well developed. The  story was well told & really gave a wonderful view of circus life.,overall
absolutely fell in love with this story, you will find yourself lost in not only the story but the era and the setting.,overall
After reading the reviews of this book I knew I would not be disappointed. This is the first book I have read from this author and I found myself interested in the book from the first sentence.The main character (Jacob Jankowski) starts the story as a 90 (or is that 93?) year old man in a nursing home living out his life. He is unhappy and realizes that his kids and the world have forgotten him. He then thinks back to his early adult life when he was in school to become a veterinarian. He takes us back to those years of the Great Depression and the adventures he had while working for a small traveling circus.The book never lets you down and the characters that Jacob Jankowski meets will keep you interested. It is a book that, in my opinion, lays open the human experience. At times, the book takes a romantic and even very sensual tone. At other times, the cruelty of the Great Depression and the desperation of people who worked hoping for some type of income or food will remind you of the harsh life of those times.The book spends some time going back and forth from present day to the days when Jacob Jankowski was part of the circus. The ending surprised me and when I finished the book I was glad that I had the pleasure of reading such a great piece of fiction.,overall
This novel is about love, murder and friendship and it's all centered around life in the traveling circus of the 1930s.  Not only does the author give history of a circus in the 30s, but she gives a very entertaining novel with very lovable characters.  She starts the novel out with the main character as an old man and then he tells the story of his days with the circus.  The old man is incredibly lovable.  The book only gets better with every page.,overall
If you loved The Help and The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, then you will love this book.  I regularly buy used copies of this book when I see them and give them to people just so they will read it.  The characters are amazing, the story is engaging and it is a truly wonderful read.  I haven't seen the movie because I heard that it just didn't live up to the book.,overall
This book was very good  I could not put it down I would recommend it to a friend and my family,overall
This is really a heart warming story. I especially loved the elderly Jacob. Working in Long Term Care, I so could see some of my patients over the years in Jacob and perhaps even caught a glimpse of how patients over the years have seen me! The ending warmed the cockles of my heart and left me smiling for days (well all day b/c I just finished it last night, but I can't see not smiling everytime I think about it). Definitely give this book  a chance. I waited when it was recommended to me b/c the Circus didn't really appeal to me, but it really was interesting to read about Circus life in the Depression Era. Loved the surprise twist when the epilogue picks back up at the end of the book! Didn's see that coming, but I guess that's the point. LOVED THIS BOOK!,overall
that is, if they say that it is a wonderful read. It is, and then some. Great characters, great story, great writing. Someone will make a movie of it, but if I were you I'd read it before they do.,overall
I didn't get an opportunity to see the movie in the theater, so I thought I'd read the book before watching it on DVD.  I'm glad I did.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was nothing that I expected and wonderful all the same.,overall
Wonderfully drawn characters, page-flipping plot,surprise grand finale. A long remembered main character who steals the show. A revelation of behind-the-scenes life with the circus.,overall
What a great adventure this books was.  I loved it.  I'll never look at an elephant the same way again.,overall
This is a sad, happy and delightful book about life in the circus in the early 1930's.  It's a book that when finished, one feels a warm satisfaction.  I wish there were more books with that &#34;feel good&#34; feeling.,overall
Enjoyed this book. Appears to be well researched and was very interesting. Good story, good read.,overall
Water for Elephants is a great read. I had a hard time putting the book down. This book has great characters, great scenes, and a great plot. I was fascinated by the narration of Jacob as an elderly man remembering his early days on the circus. I couldn't help but feel for the elder Jacob who was lonely and felt like he was just a trinket on a shelf that someone comes once a week to dust off. But the younger Jacob, I found myself rooting for him all through the story.The author has done a great job at incorporating the stories of the circus in to a story that seems so real. I was left with a connectedness to the characters and their struggles, their joys, and their feelings for one another.If you ever have ever been to the circus, and ever wondered what it would be like to work in the circus during the 1920's and 1930's when all the big circuses were traveling the United States, then this is a book you will have to read. You will not be disappointed.,overall
I have to admit that I wasn't initially excited to read this book. I kept hearing great things about it, but I just had no interest in reading about a circus. Then I saw the movie preview... and knew I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie (I'm rarely able to finish a book if I see the movie first). So I started reading, and had a hard time getting into it at first... I think this was mainly because I felt like I HAD to read the book... as if I was back in school! I eventually got past this and was able to get immersed into Water for Elephants.Usually, I rate books by how I feel while reading them, so my ratings are normally always subjective. In this case, I felt I had to give this book 5 stars based on the fantastic writing and the amazingly rich and unique backdrop of the train circus! It is obvious that the author did her research on circus culture and depression-era American history. She really dug into the down and dirty details of circus life. In the discussion after the last chapter you learn that many things in the story are based on true stories or anecdotes of the circus. The Bezini Brothers train circus is easily like another character in the book, flawed and deeply layered, like the characters themselves. I really liked how the story is told from Jacob's perspective as a spunky 93 year old man, having flashbacks of his life 70 year earlier. The altering perspectives (from young to old) effectively grounded the story and added another layer to his character.At times, this wasn't easy to read... It was sad to read about the indignities of being old, and I felt like Gruen's depiction was honest and very real. Though most of all, I had a really hard time reading some of the scenes with the animals. At one point I caught myself reading between my fingers, as if I was trying to block the scene from view as if it was a movie. I tried skipping over one but I had to go back and read it because I felt like it was important to the development of the characters and the story. It was, and they were. I just wish those scenes hadn't been seemingly timed to when I was getting ready to go to sleep.Seriously, I'm so glad I finally picked up this book. I highly recommend it!,overall
I started this book with high expectations because of my sister's recommendations. It exceeded them spectacularly. This was a beautiful story - never a dull moment. It was so fresh and so different from other books I have read. I thoroughly enjoyed every page and was sad when it was over. I missed the characters. The ending was perfect also. I was really blown away by this. One of the best I've read! Truly wonderful, especially for those with an old soul.,overall
This book is filled with adventure, history,and love. I'd seen the movie and decided to read it anyway. I'm glad I did because it was great.,overall
I could not put it down, and I found myself reading long after I should have gone to bed because I had to know what was going to happen next!! Wonderful story, and a great ending. Quick read.,overall
I was very pleased with this book. Not the harlequin romance I was expecting, but turned out to be even more. You can't help but fall in love with the relationships Jacob has with Camel, Walter, Rosie and Marlena. The author shows his humanity towards all the menagerie and roustabouts. I read the book before I watched the movie. Which I'm very glad I did. The book takes you on a deeper journey with Jacob at 93 and 23. The movie totally skips over Jacob at the nursing home. They didn't build Jacob at 93 for anyone who'd never read the book to understand him. Had I'd just watched the movie without ever reading the book. I would walk away happy, but in ignorance. I would definitely recommended this book to anyone and would advice to read the book before watching the movie.,overall
This book was recommended to me by a few different people.  I knew NOTHING about it when I went to pick it up.  I was hesitant at first.  I am not a fan of the circus at all.  But knowing that one of the friends that had recommended it is also not a fan of the circus, I was cautiously optimistic.I am glad that I gave it a chance.  It is a well written story that really draws a vivid picture for you.  A great reflection of the times with a love story that had me in tears in parts.  Highly recommend to all.,overall
I don't think words are beautiful enough to describe this book. I was in love with this from the get go. Throughout this book, I caught myself smiling as I read... full on cheesy smile, as I was totally entranced by the world I was lost in. I also found tears in my eyes over and over- both in joy and sadness. This book tore through me.I can't really review this beyond saying that Water for Elephants was magical. If you have yet to read this (which I highly doubt, considering I am one of the last people on earth to read it), stop everything and go start it now.This is one of those novels that I wish someone had thrust this one on me so I could have experienced the beauty that this story is earlier.,overall
I'll start off by saying I usually sit down to read YA fiction - even though I'm 20 years old. I prefer something light hearted and breezy. I'd seen the movie before I actually picked up this book, But I was so impressed by the movie I decided i'd take the chance to sit back and read it. Let me say it made my morning commute to work far easier. I adore this book and have already passed it on to someone else in my family. It is one of those books that i was thinking was going to be completely different to the movie, and although there are a few sizable differences, it followed the plot extremely well.We first meet Jacob a ninety something withering old man remembering the good old days when he used to be able to do whatever, whenever.. and eat basically anything he wanted. Something the nursing home wasn't allowing him to do, much to his dismay. Flicking back between old Jacob and young Jacob we're presented with some humorous banter before delving into the heart wrenching tale of his life. I felt as though i'd been thrust back in time, and was there along with them at the circus, watching everything fall in to place. It all flowed so smoothly.The author did her research, she slipped right into that era without any troubles and i found it pleasant and enjoyable. A great summer read that leaves you devouring the pages wondering what is going to happen next. I highly recommend reading this. Although there are some scenes entailing sexual content it's easily read over. Water for Elephants is a delightful, delicious read.,overall
I thought this book was wonderful!  I loved the way the author juxtaposes the young Jacob with the older Jacob; such a method has the potential to be jerky or awkward, but the transitions are smooth and the reader can easily manage to keep up with both storylines.Gruen is a skilled storyteller, I was caught from the first page and couldn't put the book down.  I love when a book does that, and makes me both happy and sad, and this book does both of these things at various points.  The most emotional aspect of the book for me was how Jacob felt about being in a nursing home, his frustration at having a \young\ mind in an older body, and being treated as though he's senile by the nursing home staff as well as his own family.  This happens a lot in our culture, we tend to pack away the old because we don't want to be reminded of what we will be one day.  Wonderful, wonderful.  5 stars.,overall
I got this book for a free read through my Amazon prime account, not sure exactly what to expect but at times I like to read outside of my normal genres and take a walk on the wild side. I was not disappointed.  This is the story of a man who is looking back on his life and how his actions helped him become the man he became.  After the death of his parents he jumps a freight train only to discover it is a circus train.  He was one exam away from becoming a veterinarian at the time of his families death and his time with the circus not only helped form his view of the world but also his view of mankind and himself.  It was moving, the characters were 3 dimensional and grew during the telling of this tale.  I couldn't put it down.  The ending was very unexpected and I found myself wondering when it was all said and done what happened next.  Although this was not in a genre I normally read I would highly recommend it.  I am an animal lover and his compassion for the beast that were used by the circus was very touching.  I found myself routing for the good guys and hating the bad guys and thinking to myself  I could so see myself doing that.  There are things that happen in everyone's life that shape them, change them and help them become the people they are meant to be. This story will touch your heart and make think back over your own life with new perspective. I give it two thumbs up a must read for anyone who has ever loved and lost or who has wondered what if?  A truly great read.,overall
Possibly the best book I've read in nearly 20 years. An easy, yet difficult at the same time read, I found myself unable to put it down although there were parts so heart-wrenching, my eyes filled with tears throughout this realistically-written novel. Also, the movie based on this book is one of the very few which Hollywood did not completely destroy (but PLEASE read the book first!).And guys, this isn't just some flaky chick-lit...my boyfriend read it with me (HIS idea!), finished it first, then hounded me to hurry up and finish reading it so he could discuss it with me. And he doesn't usually take an interest in anything that's not Lord of the Rings-esque.So, go forth, read and enjoy-I own both the book and the Kindle version-either way, it's a winner.,overall
I saw the movie before I read the book. Wish I read the book first, it was a great read.,overall
A good read. Gruen hit a home run. The vivid characters make this tale interesting. It had me laughing and crying.,overall
Although the book jacket suggested the storyline as a love story, I truly became engrossed in the life in the circus.  After reading the novel, I had to go online and check out historical facts on circus stampedes, fires, and train wrecks. Being a part of the circus family in the 1930's was no easy or safe occupation.The characters are filled with depth, and Jacob, the protagonist, gives the reader a true insight to an honest and loyal man in his twenties and nineties.Maybe it's not always easy to put in words as to the \whys\, but it's definitely a book you don't want to put down.,overall
This is honestly one of the very best books I have read in a very long time.  The author keeps you wanting to turn page after page.  I couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend this book.,overall
I really enjoyed reading this book. I was able to picture everything in my head just like it were a movie! The writer is brilliant!,overall
LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK!  I don't love fiction but I love literature and this one really made me happy!  I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!  Don't bother with the movie though.,overall
Outstanding book... very well written.  A couple snafoos with the storyline but overall DEFINITELY worth reading.  I didn't think it would be the book for me (the circus and all) but I am so glad I read it.  I would definitely recommend it.,overall
I usually dont read that many fiction books.  I happened across this one and did not put it down until I was done.  What a great book!  Great animal tale as well as adventure and romance.  I didnt think the ending was predictable as the others had said.  The ending was perfect.  Highly reccomend.,overall
This is a great, heart warming, well-written story that is probably one of my favorite books ever. It is one of those books you don't want to reach the end because you don't want to leave the people and the world the author has created. Highly, highly recommend!!,overall
Ever since I got my Kindle I've been reading a lot more.  Im SO happy that Water for Elephants was one of my picks!  This book was not at all what I expected. It was MORE!! It kept me interested since the prologue.  I couldn't put it down, I absolutely loved this book.  I highly recommend that if to everyone!  I'm now trying to get all my friends to read it.,overall
As an older person, I can relate to the 1930s and to reflecting back to my childhood.  I have not seen the movie nor do I  have any desire to see the movie version of this well written novel.  One can not improve on a great story.,overall
this book was very interesting.  i loved the history of the circus-and the reality of the story.  engrossing and wonderfully written novel.,overall
I loved this story. I purchased it a while ago when it was on sale and just got around to reading it. The story was memorable and it was fascinating to read and learn about life in a traveling circus in the early 1900's. I immediately looked for other books by this author, but since they weren't rated as well, I haven't gotten around to reading any of those yet.,overall
I didn't see the movie but saw this book available for lending so grabbed it. I'm so glad I did. It was a lovely story with people and animals. It seemed to be extremely well researched especially regarding the circus terms. Some of the animal mistreatment scenes were hard to read but, again, it seemed correct for that time and location.,overall
This is a GREAT read and I really enjoyed every bit of it. I loved the last few chapters the best. I even cried and laughed out loud several times while reading this book. It is now one of my all-time favorites and I'd recommend this book to anyone who is an adult.,overall
I loved this book.  There's nothing gimmicky or cloying about it.  It's an odd, fabulously detailed, intriguing story about a time and place totally unfamiliar to me.  It's beautifully written and has wonderful, unforgettable characters.,overall
I decided to start writing reviews since I always read through them before buying a book. I'll probably only give a handful of five-star reviews. This and Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet are my favorite books from what I've read this past year, and I've done a lot of reading.  The story just sucked me in.  Usually when a book goes back and forth between past and present there is one time period I prefer over another.  I will trudge through the less preferred period of time just to get to the better part.  In this book, I enjoyed both past and present equally. It's just well done.,overall
Though the movie was also very good, and quite accurate to the book, the book is by far the better story. I was so attached to these characters and felt truly involved in their lives. I read this book much faster than I usually read because I just couldn't wait to read what happened next. Recommended for sure.,overall
I had trouble putting it down. I so badly wanted to know Jacob had a happy ending that I had to keep going.,overall
One of the most enjoyable reads out there... A chance to run away with the circus, a well written page turner, and wonderful train ride through the age of the traveling circus.I Read this after several years of dealing with aging parents... Loved this thread in water for elephants. But the characters of the circus world fill the pages with all their escapades and big top adventures. If you want to escape into a book pick this one up!Loved every minute of it!,overall
What a beautiful story Sara has woven with \Water for Elephants\.  It really made me reflect on how difficult it must be for elderly people to have lost most of their friends and loved ones and how them can only relive the memories of their lives.  This book was captivating--love, adventure,friendship, excitement, betrayal, and the special love between animals and humans--all rolled into one wonderful tale.  From the time I started reading it-it was all I could do to put it down--kept me awake reading until I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore.I will definitely be keeping watch for any new books written by Sara Guren--she is a fantastic story teller.,overall
I have never read anything like this and I loved every page.  Very few books have actually made me gasp in shock.  There is so much about the traveling circus that is appalling yet intriguing at the same time.  And who knows what is fact and fiction?  Gruen blends the two beautifully.  I am now really interested to learn more about this era of the circus.  I read my copy in 3 days and have already loaned it out.  Trust me, this is a good book!  And so different from any story line I've ever read.,overall
I love this book!  I found it hard to put down at times.  I would recommend this book!,overall
Who knew the circus could be so full of drama? This book takes place in a time when OSHA wasn't available, before PETA and the like. Sara Gruen does an excellent job walking us through this time, exposing us to the trials of finding yourself. It's more of a story of self discovery with the circus playing second show. Just a great read and perfect for book club.,overall
Great story, compelling.  Read it in one sitting.  Lots of wonderful inside information about the circus, elephants, the 1930's.  A wonderful book!,overall
I tried to read this a few months ago and guess I was just not in the right place, however with the movie coming out I decided to make sure I read the book before seeing the movie.  Picked up my Kindle and never looked back.  It's just a great story and I enjoyed every minute of it.  The ending is absolutely wonderful, what we can all hope for at the end of our lives.,overall
I really enjoyed reading Water for Elephants, it is such a different type of story than what I'm usually used to reading. I loved how it was about a circus group and the sort-of behind the scenes of it all. I cannot wait for the movie to come out!,overall
I am always cautious about \best summer read\ type comments as I have often been disappointed.  Not this time, fantastic read looking forward to the movie,overall
Gruen masterfully brings us into the world of the Depression-era traveling circus with vivid descriptions and masterful storytelling. The characters feel like real people and within the first page any reader will become deeply engrossed in this beautiful story. A gem of a book!,overall
Honestly, I did not think I was going to like this book, but I wanted to try and read something different.  I am really glad I did, this book was just pure gold.  I could not put it down!,overall
I would like to thank Ms. Gruen for writing such a pleasant tale . I knew a child who once \ran away to join the circus\  and her life did not have as happy of an ending as did Marlena's.  I thought of her often as Jacob's life unfolded and as Rosie saved them all.,overall
I was first drawn to this novel based on a short synopsis I had read on Amazon, and after many views decided to buy the novel.  I have never been so pleased with a book purchase as I am with this one.  Just reading the jacket alone draws you in to Gruen's amazing literary ability.  I finished the book about a  month ago, and am now on to Kite Runner, yet I can't help to be disappointed as I keep comparing it to Water for Elephants and am coming up short.  Congrats to Sara Gruen, I am absolutely blown away by how well this woman can not only write, but how easily one can picture the entire novel and feel as though they are right there at the circus.  The last few chapters I found myself both grimacing and smiling - completely drawn into the book and upset that it couldn't last longer.  If there is one book that will stay with you for a long time, I am convinced it is this one.,overall
I absolutely loved this story!  Elderly man looking back on his life and what a life it was!  what a love story!,overall
I loved it! Her characters were impressive and her descriptive narrative provides a vivid setting. Both Jacob's young life as a student and a vet for a traveling circus and, as we first meet him, in his 90's in the nursing home are set before you in beautiful, & sometimes heartbreaking detail.Benzini Brother's circus is portrayed in all it's glory and in all it's horror. The Depression era, and circus life at the time, is richly described and well researched. It is a murder mystery whose ending is both surprising and yet somehow righteously predictable. Still,... it was FUN! You see the murder in the beginning, but not until the end when you have all of the story behind you, do you get to see the truth. I cheered, as did many in my book club! We all agreed that we had never LAUGHED when a murderer was revealed in a novel, until Water For Elephants!I suppose that the best way to describe this story is that it is a paradox. Our book club enjoyed it very much, with few exceptions.  It was a surprising story and one that stays with you. You will never look at the circus, or a nursing home and its residents the same way again!,overall
highly recommend this book. I couldn't put it down!!!! every chance I got that I sat for more than 5 minutes I had this book in my hands reading it!!!,overall
This book is one of my favorites... at least in a long time. Way more than a book about circus life. great for a bookclub too. we all loved this book.,overall
Gruen's latest is a page turner from start to finish. Jacob Jankowski tells his story both in the form of memories while in a nursing home, and as the real time experiences of a 23-year old failed veterinary student in the midst of the Depression. Failing his exams, Jacob flees home and hooks up with a circus; he survives in this brutal world only because he has some skill with animals. Gruen paints a marvelous, completely believable portrait of a circus of the thirties, where the ruthless Uncle Al rules with the power of life and death. He deviates from planned appearances only to pick up the pieces of other failed circuses. Once someone ceases to be of use to the show, or if the money doesn't roll in as planned, they're gone--sometimes forever. It's a harsh world, but apparently historically accurate. And the old black and white photos at the beginning of each chapter are fascinating! Gruen's meticulous research makes the book--the plot line is a bit predictable and the ending a fantasy. But this is a great summer or airplane read--engrossing but not too heavy. Highly recommended.,overall
I had this book on my \quesionable\ lists to read,  I was concerned about the animal abuse I read about in some reviews.  After seeing so many other geat reviews pop up in the last few months, i bought it.it's a blast, keeps you going from page to page.  i would guess the abuse of animals is realistic to what happened in those days. hightly recommended.  its a fast and entertaining read -,overall
I picked up this book at the airport with little idea what it was about... and spent my vacation trying to find time to read!  What a fantastic novel - tight writing, excellent character development, a great surprise ending.  I recommend it to anyone who ever heard stories about the Depression from their grandparents -- and for those who didn't, too.,overall
Ever wonder about characters you've seen around carnivals then you'll enjoy this book about train travel circus. Great cast of people and animals. Easy to read book and print.,overall
This is the incredible story of a man who was forced to say good-bye to the life he knew and expected to have to take a chance on something wild and unpredictable.  This is a story that lets you see the real person that this man becomes- with imperfections and all.  The author does an incredible job of telling the story about this man with a man's voice and perspectives.  The author is a woman and if you didn't notice that- you wouldn't be able to guess that from reading the story.  It is surprising how well she is able to get into the mind of a man.  One thing about this story that I truly loved was that it was told from a \real time\ perspective and a future perspective.  We get to see what happens to this man after his long journey.  Plus, we see that that journey never actually ends.  I can't say enough about this book.  It was a pleasure to read each and every word on each and every page.  I give it the highest review.,overall
I loved this book.  Writing was excellent and the story very revealing of what went on at that time.  I purchased this copy as a gift.,overall
This book is very well written!  I loved the suspense and the authenticity of the main character. I loved that it presented a view of animals as feeling creatures without being remotely sappy. I love the brutal truth of life during the depression and the realities of aging in America.  I read it in two days and put alls of other things on the back burner.  It is a great book!,overall
This is one of the best books I have read.  From page one until the end, I was completely taken with the story.  I was disappointed when the book ended and I ordered the next book this author, Sara Gruen, had written.I highly recommend this book.  Well done~!!  The story takes you to the circus and makes you feel as if you are living with the characters.I can't say enough good about this book~!!,overall
This is exactly what reading fiction should be, and that is a story full of interesting history, characters and a plot that leaves you guessing and that is full of emotions. I waited so long to read this book, and I have no idea why for I enjoyed it immensely.,overall
I was so pleased that I read the book before seeing the movie. It gave me an insight into how people perceive the elderly and how they react to the situations they are forced into. It also was a great love story.,overall
The amount of time and effort it took the author to obtain the FACTS incorporated into this story are SO evident and appreciated. Both the facts and fiction parts of this novel will keep you in thought long after completing the last page!,overall
My husband loved this one. He is an avid reader and likes reading all kinds of books. This is a good one.,overall
This book may start out a little dry but it gets to be super good shortly after. I really loved this book and would recommend watching the movie after you read the book!,overall
One of the best books we`ve (my wife and I) ever read. Wonderful character building, fascinating story line, lots of suspense, and in every way a great book. I couldn't put the book down once I started.,overall
My good mate John down at Matilda's book store  in Mount Waverley ordered this book in for me and it would have to be my favourite novel so far this year.The reader is introduced to 90 something year old Jacob who is a resident in an Old Folk's Home. Jacob talks about his past beginning with not completing his Vet Exams and finding himself in a travelling cirus during the Depression Era in America. Beneath the tinsel and cotton candy you find that the circus consists of hard men who never thought twice about throwing anybody from a  moving train.There is brutality and violence in this book and also the search for dignity in this cold tough world. Naturally 5 stars for this book.,overall
I wish this book never ended. the time period, the characters, the pace of the story were all perfect.  I was sorry to see the pages winding down. this was by far the best book i've read in the last two years!,overall
I could write a book about this book but will keep it short and simple.  This book tells a very entertaining story of Jacob (never referred to as \Jake\ in the book) and a twist of fate that sees his fate aligned with a circus after his parents are killed.  It's a very engaging book, well written and enough to keep you reading into the wee hours of the night.  I can't imagine the movie could possibly keep up but may give it a shot.  I don't see Robert Pattison as Jacob necessarily.Great book!  And for those who seemed to think the book fell flat - you're digging too deep for meaning - relax and enjoy a good read.,overall
such an amazing book..interesting plot line..amazing characters..vivid, real, amazing.,overall
From the moment that Jacob Jankowski hops a ride on a circus train outside of Itaca, New York the story pulls you right into the circus life. A tragic chain of events have caused Jacob to hop on this train, but the ride also causes him to meet the love of his life. The author does a brillant job of telling this story of Jacob's circus life from his own memory at the age of ninty or is it ninty three while recovering in a nursing home. This story in a story is truly delightful how Jacob handles the aging process and the other people in the nursing home. I was very impressed how the author handled the transition between stories. While the circus brought many people laughter and excitment during the \Great Depression\ and \Prohibition\, I found that the life was very tragic for some of the workers and animals. It was frankly a very hard life.,overall
From start to finish, this book captures the readers attention.It contains romance and adventure unequaled by anything I have read recently. From the title of the book, you might not think the story would be any good. You are in for a big surprise! It's no wonder this book has almost 5 star rating.Check it out. You won't regret it!,overall
Water for Elephants is a superb book with a great beginning, a great middle and a great end. This book is surly destined to be on the \required reading list\ along with books such as The Great Gatsby, The Red Badge of Courage and Hemingway's best.The book begins when Jacob, the hero, looses his parents to an accident at the time he is scheduled to sit for his final examine at Cornell University and become a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. Under duress and without finishing the exam, he walks out of the exam building and into a tumultuous life with the circus.At the age of 90, Jacob finds himself in an assisted care facility where he blows his top when a fellow senior, a lawyer, claims to have worked for the circus and delivered water for elephants. Thus begins the story of Jacob's life as a vet for a disreputable circus owner, a novel that ends as Rosie, the elephant in the story, dispatches the evil ring master.From incident to incident, the mind-capturing story flows from rich characters making this book one for the ages. Tis a great read.,overall
I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun book that keeps the reader coming back for more. It is an absolute roller coaster of human emotion that develops characters that are identifiable. Gruen's \warts and all\ approach to character development makes the story fell real and compelling. Excellent, well written book! A must read!,overall
Wow! This book was on my To-Read list for awhile before I got around to it. Somehow I didn't foresee this being about the circus, I don't know why. I read this in 2 days, I couldn't put it down. I just wanted to know what happened next! I love the way it was written too. The cruelty of the circus animals brought tears to my eyes more than once. Loved it and will recommend to it my friends for sure!,overall
Beautifully written with characters that define humanity with their strengths but more so their weaknesses, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a most touching tale that brings the reader into a completely different and lost world of the travelling circuses during the Great Depression.What makes Sara Gruen's novel all too unique is her ability to bring us into the lives of her ordinary characters leading such extraordinary existence in the circus world.  Amidst the spectacle to provide temporary entertainment lies the cruelty and the debauchery never seen outside the performance area. A grumpy dwarf and his pet, an elephant who exhibits exceptional talent and is more human than the people around her ... a circus star and a would-be vet ... who would have thought that an insight into their lives can so summarize the abandonment of youth ...and the sadness of old age reviewing an existence that has come to pass?One of the most worthwhile reads for quite a time, this novel is a gem.,overall
I enjoyed this book.  Sometimes I just love wandering through Barnes and Noble and finding a good book to read - this book was just that.  A story of aging, the circus, life, death, loved ones and more - it really has it all.It is a fun book that made me feel emotion while reading it - good work.  I would recommend for sure.  JVD,overall
I loved this book and I especially loved the fact that it did use the true carnival and circus language.You feel for and with the characers and I fully agree with the others that rated this book 5 stars.Read their reviews also they are great,overall
This is the life of Jacob Jankowski, starting after the death of his parents... his parents who paid for his education by mortgaging their farm and therefore had nothing to leave him.He hops a train to nowhere so he thinks...but it is a circus train and he becomes a 'first of May'...that means a newbie. From that time on that is his home, his work, his life.The story is self-narrated by Jacob when he is in his ninties and in an 'old folks home' and he hates every minute of his life there. And so perhaps we can imagine he passes the time by telling us his story.Gruen has circus life down pat due to I am sure many, many hours of research and has such a beautiful rhythm to her prose that you are there with Jacob. You feel the exitement, smell the animals, hear the band music, envision the clowns, hear the roar of the cats and feel the thumder under your feet as the elephants begin their parade... and the laughter and applause of the crowds.Jacob's life is not easy but it is intriguingly exciting and different. IF only he had taken the last test for his vet license...if only his parents had not died at that critical moment in his life...if only...if only...I loved this novel because it drew on every one of my emotions and satisfied my hunger for a really good story. I will never forget Jacob!,overall
Here is a delicious journey back to a gritty bygone era of big tops, roustabouts, circus trains, freak shows, midways.  Many of the extraordinary incidents in this novel, according to the author's notes, are rooted in oral history or based on anecdotes or actual written reports of those early 20th century years.  Those who rode the circus rails, many being family castaways and society's rejects, found family and home in that unique traveling milieu of humanity and managerie, and, in the process, grew tough in body and spirit.  BUT, even if you don't give a hoot about circuses or circus people, don't be put off by the title or theme.  (Although, is there really anyone in their 30s plus years who did not, as a child, sit and watch wide-eyed, delighting in the cheap glitz, the pulsating music, the flamboyant and rhinestone-studded costumes and, yes, the size and smell of the elephants, when the circus came to town?) This story is nostalgic in its telling, engaging in its characters, with a plot that clearly aligns the good guys against the bad.  There are wonderful descriptions of authentic circus activity, on-site intrigue, and a romance that you will really care about.  All of this, tucked into the ruminations of a contentious 90-year-old \assisted-living\ resident whom you will also really care about.I suspect, however, one would have to have a soft spot for animals to want to open this novel and then to inhale it, as I did, in just a day and a half.  Like savoring a wonderful dessert, I was torn between the discipline of consuming it in small lady-like portions and making it last for as long as possible or just gobbling it down and enjoying it all at once.,overall
I loved this book! I couldn't put it down! It was a bit \fluffier\ reading than I originally thought it would be, but it was fabulous none-the-less. The descriptions are vivid, not cliched; the characters are interesting; and the weaving of present-day Jacob with the Jacob of a bygone era is delightful.I would call this a must read... not because it will change your life or make you think about the world around you, but because it is just so enjoyable. I gave it a 4.5 because it isn't a book that will make you think long after the last page is read, but it will make you sad you've left the colorful circus world of Jacob Jankowski.,overall
I really enjoyed this book, as did lots of people I leant it to.,overall
I had heard of this book for awhile and kept considering it but I hate to say it wasn't until I saw the trailer for the movie coming out soon that really caught my attention. So the next day I went out and bought it, starting it immediately. The story is extremely well written, with details that enabled me to picture how everything appeared in a big top circus during that time. You immediately connect with Jacob from the start as his journey continues, pulling for him page after page. The other characters are well written with the story, feeling the happiness, joy and sadness each of them feel as the story continues.It's really hard not to say too much without giving the story away. This is a book I will be recommending to everyone as it is a story that has a bit of everything wrapped into one- so many emotions page after page. Knowing the fate of most the characters at the end, you want more but already have an idea of how their story ends.,overall
College guy joins a travel by train circus and flips over the beautiful star married to a jealous, sadistic husband.  The first person point of view makes his crushing on her vivid.The author's historical research adds fascinating info.  She does not hold back on the sex or violence.  The characters are outsized; good idea for a circus story.This is one of the most entertaining novels I've ever read.,overall
A wonderful star-crossed lover story that takes place in the middle of a traveling circus back in the early 1900s.  For those that like 'The Notebook' or 'Eat, Pray, Love' I think you would like this one as well.,overall
You will love this book! If you love fiction this book is great. I heard the movie shuffles some of the story around. However this is a great read and I could not wait to finish it.,overall
I enjoyed this book so much, I did not want the story to end.  Alternately told between the main character as a youth and reminiscing as an old man.  This takes you back to a time when the world was a lot simpler, if you remember the time when a circus would show up in your small town and just as quickly disappear.  The end is a gem, won't spoil it for those who have not read it.  I couldn't put it down, just pure entertainment.,overall
Have you ever asked yourself these questions? \What is a life worth? How do you judge if someone is worth saving? What does it mean to be human? What distinguishes an animal from a human being?\ Hidden beneath this easy-to-read though dark coming-of-age romance is a theme that prompts the reader to ask the above questions. The answer come through the reminiscing of protagonist Jacob Jankowski--a man at the end of his fascinating life. The story begins with the circus rolling into town, triggering a flood of Jankowski's memories, full of pleasure, joy, love, hate, regret & guilt. Sara Gruen brings the quaint circus existence of the mid 20th century to life through meticulous research and wonderful storytelling. Anyone who ever dreamed of running away to the big top or just dreamed of running away should read this book.,overall
I purchased this book to read before I saw the movie. Actually never finished it, and went to the movie--which was excellent.Overall transaction to acquire this book was fantastic.,overall
What a wonderful story of a rag-tag bunch of people and animals, who just happened to be called a circus!  They traveled by train during the depression and had some fascinating adventures along the way.  We meet Jacob Jankowski, a young man who accidently lands  on the train.  He decides to stay and become the circus veterinarian.  He meets lovely Marlena and her evil husband, August.  Of course he falls in love with her, but the husband is a force to be reckoned with.  There is also Walter (Kinko)the clown, Big Al, Camel, and of course Rosie the Elephant.  The ending is extremely satisfying.  This book is well-researched and authentic.  I loved it!,overall
This is one of those books that stays with you long after reading it. I saw the movie too but it was the book that held me in its grip. This book is hard to put down. It is so well written that you really feel you are inside the story. It takes you there. And it takes you there FAR better than the movie ever could. I will read it again someday. That is a rare statement from me.,overall
Very well written. Interesting comparison between a youth & himself as an old man, and between characters with compassion and some with none.,overall
Well I think the sign of a good book is when you put it down and you are still thinking about the characters or the storyline because you can't get them out of your head.  That was definitely true of this book!I had heard and read a lot about Water for Elephants which actually put me off reading it as It meant my expectations were sky high and I wasn't sure if the book would be able to live up to them.  But let me tell you that it certainly did.I was a little apprehensive about how it started, with Jacob in his golden years reflecting on his youth, but in the end I found this was actually one of the things I enjoyed about how the book was written.  Like Jacob, I longed for the times when his mind slipped back to his younger years when his body was whole and his mind sharp, when his passions ran high and his life was full of adventure.  I could relate to his frustration with his age, mental status and physically limitations.The story of his life was emotional, and felt very real.  The ending was surprisingly satisfying for the reader and Jacob, possibly because Jacob received what we all hope for at the end of a long life.  I'm not going to say anymore than that, as i dont want to give anything away so if you want to know more you will have to read it yourself.  I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.,overall
The story is well written, fun to read, and has an unexpected ending. Although a bit gruesome in places, it was great fun to read.,overall
Books are always better than the movie, and that's true for this one.  The choking scene in the movie upset me greatly (having been a victim of domestic violence), so I was glad it was not in the book (it was referred to, but a pulling of her necklace rather than the full-on, two-hands choking scene of the movie.  Love this one, as well as Gruen's other books.,overall
When my friend first mentioned I should read this book, I hesitated because of the subject of animal abuse. But I did read it and from the beginning was drawn in by the old man as he begins to tell his story. The story is so deeply sentimental and vivid in descriptives. The characters are unforgettable and this includes the animals. Yes it was painfully sad and I was angered when the abuse was occurring but still I read on. I must say this book made a big impression upon me as far as a story of adventure, travel, history and love all rolled into one. When I had my first book read for my debut novel on Friday, June 13th, 2008 the store manager (who took a chance on an unknown self-published author) predicted that my book, like \Water for Elephants\, would have the same impact in time. She had said that Sar Gruen at first couldn't get the attention her book deserved but on went life to where WFE ended up being one of the most interesting accounts of US circus story ever told.  Although I saw no comparison with WFE and my novel, The Skye in June, I welcome her prediction and await the results. But! Buy WFE and like me, keep it in your library to reread in the years to come.,overall
Wow! Water for Elephants was recommended by a friend of mine. She loved the book so much, she bought it for me. I am happy she did!! This story was heartfelt, mind blowing, awesomely good!!!!!! Sara definitely has a masterpiece on her hands. Jacob and Marlena' s life, Rosie, all the crew, and other animals. What they went through and how they end up. I loved and cried. Camel and Walter, so sad. Water for Elephants is A must read!!!!!!!,overall
It honestly took me weeks to finally talk myself into buying this book, I just said screw it and did it. I started reading it and could not put it down. By far my favorite book. (this month anyhow) I love to read the books before I see the movie and even though 9 out of 10 times I am very disapointed with the movie I honestly can not wait to see this movie! I think that the book was so real and made me feel like part of the circus so much that watching the movie will make me feel even more so part of the circus. I passed this book along to a \reading buddy\ of mine and told her just read it! She text me the next day and said she had just finished it and it was SOOOOOO GOOD (This girl in not one to read a book in a day) If you are reading these reviews trying to descide weather to buy this or not by suggestion is.... Just buy it! Well worth the money!,overall
I read this book at the recommendation of a client...I loved it!  I read this book quite some time ago about two years ago and still think about some of the characters.  While reading this book, I often found myself so deep in the story, I could smell the smells and hear all of the people talking.  I want to see the movie as I am sure it will be entertaining, my only concern outside of the obvious, (if you read a lot you will agree it is a rare movie that can compare to the book).  I  so enjoyed this book and I would be disappointed if the characters were not portrayed as beautifully on the big screen as I have them in my mind.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a beautifully written story that is sure to stay with you long after the final page.,overall
my father read the book first... He then talked my mother into reading this book... who then talked me into reading this book... we all came away from the book with loving different parts of the book... If your looking for a great book to read and have not read this book... I will try to talk you into reading this book.Its a great book for all ages.,overall
I loved this book.  It was sometimes hard to read, when Rosie the elephant was being beaten, for example, but overall, it was so incredibly good.  One point that bothered me, though.  WHY did the author NOT have Jacob turn back and look for Walter???  Just because the other men said he \probably did not survive the night\ does not mean he didn't.  At very least Jacob SHOULD have gone back and found out for sure, especially since Walter had done a lot of good for him.  That was the only part of the book I felt let down by, although I still loved the book.,overall
This book was so wonderful and so interesting that you can't put it down!  I read it in less than a day and even forgot to eat because I just couldn't stop reading because I wanted to see what happened next.  It is a must read!!!,overall
Easy to follow with strong philosophical and social belief shown.  Will be using examples from book to help my students to the common core.,overall
I loved this book. It's about an lonely old man in a nursing home who's memories are sparked with the circus comes to town. He remembers back to his youth when he left veterinary school because of his parent's tragic deaths and joined the traveling circus. He details his unique experiences in the traveling show and of all the colorful people he became friends and enemies with. As mentioned in the title, there is an elephant, but the story is really about a young man's experiences as he struggles and learns his place in the hierarchy of circus and in life. Highly recommended!,overall
I judge a book by how compelling it is. To me, this was a great read. I couldn't put it down. I thought the movie was disappointing in comparison.,overall
I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I felt like I was right there with the characters as I read.  Couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  There were many twists and turns to the story that I didn't expect, and the ending was a suprise!  Thought I had it figured out, but not so.  Don't hesitate to pick up this one.,overall
This is a great book to get lost in. The characters are well developed and you can see the story the author is tells about life during the great depression working in a circus.  It's about people who are down on their luck that come together to help others and the animals.  It's one of those rare books when your lucky enough to find one that's hard to put down. Great fiction with a historical basis that lends credibility.,overall
It was hard to put this one down.  Very easy to follow.  I laughed a little and cried a little.,overall
I feel so lucky.  I read A Thousand Splendid Suns and now this! And I don't know which I liked more.There were a few holes in the storyline, but that's easily forgiven with her wonderful insight and delightful way with words.The present day Jacob gave me a good laugh.  The latter day Jacob made me sad.A book I will recommend to many.,overall
Loved this book from start to finish! One of the best books I have read in quite some time!,overall
The first book I've read on my kindle. Loved it, couldn't put it down. Definitely putting itbon my reread list!,overall
I've been done reading this book for weeks now, and I still can't stop thinking about it. What a great find.,overall
I loved this book and never wanted it to end. I've read it several times and each time I have enjoyed it even more.If you like a great book with adventure this is the one for you. It was absolutely amazing. Never a dull moment.,overall
The story was captivating.  I never lost interest and could hardly put it down.  Although I never had any real interest in circus life or the shows in general I had been told it was an interesting book.  I found the story one to draw you right into the action and drama as it unfolded and the ending was just perfect.  When you finish the book it is with a smile and a good feeling.,overall
The best contemporary novel I have read in a long time. The book was obviously well researched, the characters believable, and the setting was intriguing. I had this book a while before deciding to read it...and I'm glad I finally delved in. I wish Tobey Maguire were in the movie as Jacob. I can see him clearly in my minds eye....Oh well.  That's why books are better than movies, lol. You can cast whomever you want in the starring roles.,overall
This fascinating story held my interest throughout. I did not want to put the book down, and I did not want it to end. At the same time I learned about working and living on the road with a circus, and how it was that people survived in rural America during the depression era. This was a truly remarkable human story that will be of interest to anyone, but especially to those who are interested in knowing more about those years in the US.,overall
This book was a great read from beginning to end. It's hard to believe it was a novel as the history of the old circus life seemed all to real.. it will make you wonder why anyone would have ever said I'm going to run away and join the circus. A must read.The,overall
This sat in my closet for a few years and I finally pulled it out. LOVE!!!!!!! I'm hoping my momtakes my advice and reads it herself,overall
wonderful  story really enjoyed it, never looked at the circus the same way. very heart wrenchingand touching from the perspective of an outsider.,overall
Loved it. Had me hooked right from the beginning.  I'm not much of a circus person, but after reading this book it made me look up more books about that era of the circus life. I would highly recommend this book.,overall
This book was a fun read.  There was a real twist at the end!  Loved it!,overall
This book was nothing short of amazing. From the first page to the last, I did not want to put it down and when it ended, I was sad it was over. One of the things that makes the book so strong is the characters. from Jacob to August to \Rosie\, there isn't a character that I did not feel moved by at one point or another.There is a dark side to the circus life and this book will show you things you never imagined that happen outside the Big Top. So, if you are going to buy one book this year, make it this one.,overall
This book is like no other I've ever read.  The setting, main characters, and plot are very interesting, letting you in on a lifestyle that most people would never get to experience.  I was totally intrigued from the very first page! A good book and very different.  I highly recommend it!,overall
Fantastic story, it had me from beginning to end. Quite brutal in places. After reading this book I had to watch the movie which does not quite do it justice!,overall
This was a wonderful story of how life is on the traveling circus and how lives were intertwined. The characters were great and easy to get into. I could not put it down.,overall
This book has it all...devastation, adventure, friendship, humor, romance, plus it's beautifully written with a wonderful ending to boot, what's not to love!Jacob is extremely naive and young in his life, from a nice home with loving parents and a successful career in plain sight; what he learns on the train is a real jolt into the life of a nomad and as a reader you get to experience his growth into a man.  One women in my book club felt it was a tad graphic and even though I agree to a point I felt it was necessary for us to see Jacob experience a world of unspoken truths.  The life on a circus train exposes him to situations that he definitely wouldn't have seen as a neighborhood vet, including, sex, alcoholism, prostitution, starvation, survival... This is written from Jacob's perspective, a boy who's been snatched from a life of predictable comforts and is thrown into a nomadic life aboard a, virtually life-threatening, train to nowhere; of course it's going to be a bit graphic and detail emphasized!This book really transports you into an era long past and I could feel and smell the circus.  It also makes you want to run to the nearest retirement home and volunteer.  The characters were very well developed and believable as were the animals.  I didn't turn the last page with any disappointment; the story was complete and satisfying, no open endings, no need for a sequel.  Excellent, one I will read again.  The movie didn't hold a candle to the book.,overall
I have read the author's other books and this has been my favorite. I love all of the history. Very easy and enjoyable read.,overall
What a fun story, cleverly delivered as Jacob moves back in time to relive his story and returns to the present, his disgruntled present.  Some critics have complained about the ending, but I'd have to say they are Bah, humbug critics.  The ending is delightful, one of the best ever. This is a feel good story and it IS fiction, so the complainers, IMO, just don't understand Suspended disbelief.  The story is magical in its authentic setting and making you feel you are under the big top. It is sometimes shocking, sometimes painful, always compelling. Don't miss this one.  ...Karleene Morrow, author of Destinies, a novel.,overall
While certainly Water for Elephants includes the harsh reality of what circus life was like during the depression, I found it more of a story of hope, love and survival. How desperation drives people to do tragic things to one another, yet just when you think all is lost, a surprising hero can save the day.As with any good story, the author must offer conflict and contrast, and as much as animal cruelty existed in the story, so did an intense love for animals that some of the characters had. In many ways this story was one of good vs. evil set in the unusual backdrop of the circus train.This is one of my new favorites.  I read it twice, about a year apart and I enjoyed it as much the second time.,overall
I was surprised on how much I liked this book.  Once I started, I could not put it down.  Loved the story from the lead male characters perspective. The detail was so good, I could envision the Circus environment like I was there.  The story was both sad and funny and had several good supporting characters. I can definately see Reese Witherspoon in the movie as the female lead.  Great Reading!!,overall
I love this book because the characters are engaging and unique, the settings both mundane and fantastical and the ending perfect! I want to be Jacob J. when I get old(er).  Thank you for a marvelous book.,overall
A good read and most enjoyable.  The humor in this book about nursing homes is right on the mark. The characters are believable and likeable.  The story line is good and romantic.  The ending is open for discussion--but good.,overall
This is the best book I've read in a very long time. I can't stop thinking about it. The characters are so real, so colorful. I am in love.,overall
After reading the book I rented the movie.  The movie held true to the book.  The developing love story between Man, Woman and elephant was totally engaging.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an exciting tale of circus life.  Job well done.  I look forward to reading more by this author,overall
This was a very good book. It was interesting moved quickly. The characters were well developed and about mid book I worried the book would have a sad ending (I don't care for sad endings). But I was pleasantly surprised. I eloaned this book to my daughter who is enthralled with it as well.,overall
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. The author does a great job of holding the readers interest by flashing back and forward. I never felt a lull in the story.,overall
I am truly enjoying the story and the characters.  There are certain parts of the book I felt the author could have left out and really added no benefit to the story.  The sexual content of them was too much for me.  But all in all worth the read.,overall
Probably any tale set at a travelling circus is going to be wonderfully colorful, but this one surpassed my expectations. I was so engrossed in what was going to happen with all the characters, and just absolutely loved the whole thing.,overall
I don't think this story could have been any better than it was. I read it front to back in one sitting. I just couldn't put it down! I don't read reviews before I read a book, I'll read anything I can get my hands on. When I got this book I flipped through it, and I didn't think I'd like it because of the pictures. But after the FIRST page I was hooked. I LOVED LOVED LOVED Jacob and Marlana...and HATED Uncle Al and August. I wanted to cry everytime Auggie went to the tent to lay it on Rosie. It made me sick. It's been a while since I read something so moving! A+++++++++,overall
Read the book in two days. Pulls you in and keeps you wanting more from beginning  to end. Also, one of the best book endings I've ever encountered. Absolutely loved this book!,overall
Definitely one of my favorite books I've read recently!  The historical accuracy and intriguing plot line had my attention from the first chapter.  MUST READ!!,overall
Loved the story telling, wish I had read it BEFORE seeing the movie. Felt like I was traveling with them.,overall
I couldn't put this down! what a great series! I read through it so quickly and really enjoyed the story behind it!,overall
Sara Gruen's gorgeous new novel, 'Water For Elephants,' unfolds as a dual narrative, alternating between Jacob Jankowski's life as a nonagenarian, and his time spent working for a ragtag Depression-era circus as a young man. The plot is captivating (I missed two meals because I didn't want to put the book down) and Gruen's writing, as always, is transcendent. She deftly evokes a fascinating period in American history that deserves to be revisited, and her characters--human and animal alike--will stay with you long after you turn the last page.,overall
This book was extremely well written and absolutely amazing!  I love the story and the author's vivid descriptions.  There were parts that angered me, parts that broke my heart, and parts that made me laugh out loud!  Very well done!,overall
This book is one of the best I have read in a very long time. The author puts you in the depression era circus travels. The writing is so good you can almost smell the popcorn and peanuts. You experience the animals and the humans alike. I could not put it down and finished it in 2 days. Well worth your time!! I am sending it along to my family members.,overall
I loved this book and especially liked the ending.  I couldn't wait to finish reading it so I could pass it on to others to enjoy. The narrative by the protaganist was so real you could feel and smell the scenes depicted as though it were you experiencing the events.  I highly recommend this book.,overall
I came into this book not expecting much at all, and ended up excessively loving it! This is one of those stories where you think you've figure out exactly how everything is going to go . . . And then nothing turns out the way you thought it would.Books that have a frame for the story like Water for Elephants had will, if done well, really get me to know and love the characters. Having Jacob's narration of the circus events interrupted by `present day Jacob' was a nice little detail. I definitely felt sad for the ninety-something year old, feeling nearly helpless and lonely. As he feels he's losing control of his life, his mind slips back to the past, and through these lapses we're told the story.I never knew anything about how circuses traveled about in the past, and hearing about the cutthroat America during the Great Depression certainly brought an overpowering feel of reality to the story. Jobs were few and far between, and those that had them did anything they could to keep them. Describing the desperate times, the hobo jungles, and the pay cuts served to present a great representation of the time period.I loved hearing about the different circus acts, though I know that was but a miniscule part of the story. The tiny facts and funniest little things kept my interest and had me smiling. This book is definitely dark and depressing at moments. At others, it is brilliantly bright and full of hope. Any novel that can pull off both sides of the spectrum nearly flawlessly is excellent in my book.I give Water for Elephants 5/5 stars. It was fantastic, and I'll definitely have to check out the upcoming movie now! I really recommend it. I have a feeling it is one of those books I will never forget.,overall
I loved this book, it was one that I couldn't put down. I would recommend this to anyone who has done time on their hands!,overall
If everything this author writes is this enjoyable, all I can say is, if she writes them, I'll buy them!,overall
This is truly a well written book. The author let's you clearly see a very frail old man, his present hospital-like surroundings including the nursing staff and other elderly people in this assisted living facility.The author is clever enough to break up the terrible animal and human cruelties and sadness of the early 1930's era, the circus itself and the indignities some humans endured by inserting enough humor and back flashes to keep the reader from getting very depressed.This is not a pretty story, but it certainly reminds me of the era, which I am old enough to remember, not from a circus life, but from the life of a very poor, homeless family.The author took me back to places I have not been in several decades. I can smell the circus animals, see the uppity \performers\ as well as the horrible \tents\, the freaks and the laborers who set up and take down the tents.  I can visualise from the words of Sara Gruen, the trains in which many circus people travelled. Oh, yes, believe it or not as a little child, but old enough to remember, this is a mode of travel I recall vividly.I have put Sara Gruen's other books on my Amazon wish list and if I don't receive them as gifts I will eventually buy them for myself.  Her written words come close to looking at old photograps in her novel \Water for Elephants\.,overall
Lovvveeee this book. The story is awesome! I cried soo many times. This book def tugs at your heart! ESP, for animal lovers!,overall
I loved this book.  The author really wrote this book in a different way.  A 93 year old in a home in one chapter then the next it is about himself as a young man.  Then back to the nursing home and back to the young man's life.  I could not put the book down.  I hope I can find more books written as well as this one.,overall
Wow. I hope that's not all I can say about this book, but that's where I'll start. Wow.Every time I hesitate to think I'll find a book that is captivating, entertaining, and that will keep my interest and keep me thinking about its characters long after the book is over, I somehow seem to find myself happily surprised. Water for Elephants was one of those books. It was really that good.I heard good things about it, always saw it on the shelves at bookstores, but it wasn't until recently that I decided to give it a chance. Why? A book about a circus in the depression/prohibition era is probably as far away from my \normal\ reading zone as I can get.  But I'm telling you - it doesn't matter! Not one bit.Entertaining and engrossing from the very first chapter, I was taken away on this journey with the characters. Nothing short of fascinating, in ways I wouldn't have thought possible.  Part love story, part coming of age, this is at its roots, a story about life and the unexpected paths it may take. I really came to love the character of Jacob, and sympathize with his situation and his love for animals. It's been over a week since I've finished the novel, and I still think about the characters every day.  I really got caught up in their world which is something, I must say, is sometimes way too rare in the books I read. Many are good stories, but with Water for Elephants, I really felt like I was traveling along with them in their adventures. A pleasant surprise.Overall, I have already recommended to more than a few friends, and would encouragingly recommend it here. It may just be one of those precious few books that when you finish it, you stop and, at a loss for words, say - wow.,overall
how could you not love this book, or the movie... they are both fantastic stories... and beautifully done... i loved everything about it...,overall
This book hit every note for me.  Gruen had me the moment she introduced Jacob as a veterinarian and Marlena as a horsewoman.  Perfection!The adventures, the setting, the desperation of the animals, the workers and of the lovers all came together to make such a beautiful, memorable read for me. Sweet revenge and a perfect ending make this one of my top ten reads (and re-reads) time after time.  I've since recommended it to many people and it remains a favorite to this day.,overall
I read this book last year and am sincerely hoping that the movie is able to sufficiently capture the adventure, romance, and poignancy.  I not only enjoyed the flashbacks to the days in the circus - I REALLY enjoyed the perspective of the character in a current day nursing home.  This book has it all and is written in a way that it easily became a movie in my mind as I read.  Many times books like this have sad endings but the ending to this story is excellent!  I highly recommend this book.,overall
I love it when a friend hands you a book and says it's one of the best she's read and I can pass it on to everyone I know!  Hope you love it as much as I did.,overall
I had this book on my to read list for some time, when I saw that the movie was coming out soon I decided I better get to reading this.  I listened to this as an audio book and it was very well done; they have two readers one for Jacob in his twenties and one for Jacob in his nineties.  It was a good read and I enjoyed learning about the circus.Jacob is ninety three and living in a retirement home, through his dreams and daydreams he relives a tumultuous time in his life in his twenties.  When Jacob is in his twenties he is getting ready to sit for his Veterinarian finals at Cornell University when he gets a call; his parents have been killed in a car accident.  Then when he gets home he finds out that the bank has seized his parents' house.  In a fit of grief and sorrow he abandons his exams and hops a train that just happens to be part of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  Through a series of circumstances he ends up working for them as their vet; taking care of the exotic animals in their menagerie.  In the process of all of this he falls in love with a beautiful performer named Marlena who has a brutally viscous husband, who also happens to be Jacob's boss.There were a number of things I liked about this book.  The story moves quickly and has a sense of mystery and doom about it as Jacob falls deeper into the seedy goings on in the circus and deeper in love with Marlena.  It is very engaging.It is clever how you see into Jacob's life in the present while he is in a nursing home.  These portions of the story really tug at your heart and give insight into an old man struggling to retain his sense of self in an environment where everything is sanitized and ordered.  These glimpses are bittersweet in contrast to the crazy life Jacob lived; obviously this man has lived and lived well and it is heartbreaking to watch him struggle with the descent into age that we are all faced with.The majority of the story is about Jacob's life in the circus.  Gruen doesn't shy away from the nitty gritty including sex, violence, language; as such this is definitely an adult read.  Issues such as animal cruelty, squalid living conditions for workers, and the Depression are woven throughout.  Making the story very believable and easy to relate to.All of the characters in this book are very human and engaging and have a lot of depth. Even the villainous characters (Al and August) have moments of graciousness and goodness.  While the main \good\ characters do things that border on bad, if only through neglect.The only thing that really bothered me with this book is that I thought Jacob made too many bad decisions and too many mistakes.  I understood that he was young and hot-headed, but at the same time he is supposed to be very smart...and well...let's just say he doesn't spend much time thinking about his actions.  A lot of what happened he brought on himself and I think that this was inconsistent with the way he was presented as an upstanding citizen and character.The book ends well and should leave readers happy and smiling.  The story is expertly told and the look into the way a circus runs fascinating.  It would have been nice to have an afterward of Gruen talking about how accurately she represented the circus in this book.  Were all circuses like this?  Or was this one particularly bad?Overall this was a very engaging story, I enjoyed it a lot, and am happy that I read it.  The characters are fascinating, the glimpses into both life in the circus and life in a nursing home intriguing as well.  I loved how the book was set up with us seeing the elder Jacob's memories/story through his eyes.  Definitely a book to check out if you are at all interested in circuses or people living during the Depression Era.,overall
This was a fantastic story.  Jacob Jankowski is a 93 year old man.  When the circus pays a visit to the lot across from the Nursing Home he lives in, it takes him back to when he was employed by a circus during the depression.  And so the book alternates between today and the 1930's.  This book grabbed me from the beginning.  Especially since Jacob attended school at Cornell and caught the circus train on it's way to Utica.  Places I am very familiar with.  The fact that he is Polish is another plus.  This story is put together very well.  Gruen obviously did her research and I finish this book with some knowledge about Jamaica ginger paralysis, exotic animal behavior and of course, the circus.  It is definitely going on my personal list of \classics\ and \1001 books to read before you die\.,overall
This was a great book!  I knew nothing about the circus and the life of its performers and workers.  Now I feel like I lived through it!  Sara's story was a page turner for sure.  Excellent!,overall
I absolutly LOVED this book! The characters jump off the page and you are transported into another time, in another world that is the circus life.  Once I started this book I never wanted to put it down.  I can't wait to read Sara Gruen's other titles, she is obviously a very talented author.Take my word for it, you'll LOVE this book!,overall
I started reading this book because I had seen the movie and loved it. Everyone said the book was better. The book is better but I wish I had read it first. It was a page turner - I had trouble putting it down.,overall
This was a great book. Could not put it down. I wanted to read more adventures from the main character.,overall
I enjoyed the book much more than the movie (always do)! It was as touching as &#34;The Notebook&#34; for me.,overall
This is a beautiful novel about the trials and tribulations of being on the road with the circus. The horrors that befall the working men as well as the animals are absolutely atrocious but it is written in a heartfelt and sympathetic way.,overall
I was curious.  I knew there was a movie based on the book.  I had never seen that movie as I thought it looked cheesy.  So I took a chance on the book and was not disappointed!What a view into the circus culture!  Things the customers don't see and would never expect!  I've been dying to see the movie since and can't find it in Redbox and none of my friends own it.  And it's not On Demand!  I will see it at some point though.  I think now it will be worth it.,overall
Very good novel. I could not stop reading it. I was engaged at all times during the reading and loved every chapter of it. Easy to read.,overall
Not your typical love story at all. I haven't read a book in some time and couldn't be happier that this was the book I chose.  Captivating, thought provoking, touching and just plain wonderful. Easy to pick back up and remember where you left off, if you can put it down.  I just loved it.,overall
I loved this book! So well written. It has everything you want in a book! Don't miss this one.,overall
What can I say that hasn't been said? This is a great book, and at this writing is $4.17 for Kindle, which cannot be beat. If you're even thinking about buying it, go ahead and get it. You won't be disappointed.,overall
This was a great story! I found myself unable to put it down, completely immersed in the characters. And the ending was everything I hoped it would be.,overall
I purchased this as an audiobook.  My husband and I listened to it on our trip down to and back from Iowa over Christmas. This was his first audiobook ever.  (Actually, his first book for pleasure since he was in high school.) This was a fantastic story! We found ourselves discussing the characters and storyline as if they were real when we would stop for lunch, etc.  I typically sleep for most of the drive (thankfully I am the passenger) but this book kept me awake the entire drive.The storyline starts out with main character as an old man. Then switches to him as a young man and how he ends up working with a circus that travels by train from location to location.  The characters are introduced beautifully. Each character has a distinct voice in the audiobook. Even though the story moves from present time and back to the past throughout the story, there is no confusion as to what \time\ the story is in.  We are still talking about this book every so often.Kimberly,overall
This is a real page turner.  I started it yesterday and I cant seem to put it down.  It shows you what it must have been like to be part of a traveling circus in the 20's.,overall
Kimberly Bowling OH USA.then this is it... I never knew a story based around a circus would be so good. A read woth reading. Cant wait to see what eles the author comes out with.,overall
I saw the movie and the book was great. You get such a better incite into the characters. I thoroughly enjoyed it,overall
\Water for Elephants\ is wonderful Depression-era circus history retold with a compelling story line. I was fascinated by this carefully researched, well-written look at the circus as a community with its own cultural norms, traditions, pecking order, and social bonds.A little-bit love story, a little-bit adventure,the underlying message is that individuals can overcome adversity if they are brave enough, or desperate enough, to take their lives into their own hands.This is the story of Jacob Jankowski, a Cornell vet student who loses everything in the Great Depression; parents, home, incipient career. Almost by accident he becomes a circus veterinarian. After a long and successful life, the elderly Jankowski escapes from a nursing home to once again join the Big Top.The author agiley shifts between Jacob's memories of circus life and his life in the nursing home. As Jacob's memories and present-day realities merge, the line between truth and fiction blurs. Perhaps Mr. Jankowski really did toddle off in his walker to be reabsorbed into the circus world; perhaps he died dreaming in his wheelchair.This is a lovely book; well-worth reading if you are interested in early twentieth-century history and/or the aging process.Kim BurdickStanton, Delaware,overall
A great story wonderfully told!  This book had been on my list for months.... now I wonder why I took so long getting to it!,overall
As with most books made into movies, this book is better. It provides thicker, more complex/developed characters, relationships and events. The writing style was perfect for the tone of the story and the storyline was fast-moving.,overall
Best book I've read in a long while.  I enjoyed the the way the author move back and forth in time.,overall
Loved this book...it was for our book club otherwiseI wouldn't have read it...and come to find it willbe a movie this year too which I'm also looking forward to...loaningthis one to my sister who's a brand new Kindle owner--I normally dont alwaysread a book this quickly....but this was so good I couldn't put it down andread it in a weekend!!,overall
I had already seen the movie and enjoyed the story. But the novel was very descriptive, to me that makes or breaks a book.,overall
When I first started to read this book I thought I would never be able to stay interested in a \circus\ book. I was sooo wrong. This is a book about circus life but it is so much more. I read it in a day. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down. Buy it....you won't be disappointed.,overall
How do we see older people as burdens or a trove of interesting knowledge and life experience. Water for elephants brings these thoughts to the for front and makes you look deep into the values of life itself.,overall
This is one of those reads that, when you are done, you cannot get out of your mind!  I have loaned my book out many times, always insisting I get it back.  The characters are endearing, and the story line is great!  I can't wait to see if this becomes a movie!  Whenever I have someone ask for recommendations for good reads, this is at the top of my list.,overall
We are all going to be old one day and remember the times of our youth. This book takes you back to the time of a young man as he slaved his way for a traveling circus. It is all about trials, hardships, and love prevailing, of course. I could not stop reading this book and in the end could only imagine myself as the character wanting for a last taste of my youth.,overall
This was an excellent story! Puts truth to the phrase, you never know where life will take you! I definitely want to visit the Ringling museum in Sarasota, fl. This book gives an insight to the circus that I never would have imagined. Great Story!,overall
A beach read or a mental health day, I spent my day on the back balcony at the circus.  Just my childhood trips to the circus, this book makes want to run away with the circus.  Best book i have read in a long time.,overall
Have you ever experienced an unexpected disaster, something that leaves you completely alone? Water for Elephants tells the story of life after tragedy, when Jacob Jankowski is accidentally thrust into a chaotic circus whirlwind. He discovers the truth about life on a circus for both the performers and workers but more importantly the circus animals. A veterinary major at Cornell university drop out, Jacob needed a break from the world that had plummeted toward him at a thousand miles an hour. Leaving him with not a cent, not a family member, and no certain future.This 5 star book opened the eyes of many across the world to the condition of a circus life in the early 1900's, and how this life could go spinning out of control at any given moment. Each page rich with love, hate, and jealousy, Sara Gruen creates a masterpiece of twists and turns aboard the `Flying Squadron' with the `Benzini Brothers most Spectacular Show on Earth'. This book shows the greed and hunger for money and wealth and the harsh conditions of the Great Depression from front to back. Her writing leaves you hanging on every word, and her distinct characters introduced throughout the story never expose their comfortable selves among the dishonest businesses of the circus. Definitely a 5 star novel, I recommend this book to both teenagers and adults as a MUST read book, Water for Elephants truly makes a difference.-kd,overall
I know there are hundreds of reviews for this book, but I liked it so much, I just had to add mine. I usually read a book before seeing the movie. I fing that the book is generally better than the movie. This book was amazing. I felt like I was living in a real circus. I am also a nurse, so can identify with the main character in a nursing home. Nursing home people are so very lonely. anyway, this is a real story, like the ones you were told when you were young. It took me back and made me feel like I was truely there. You have to read it. Maybe I'll see the movie now.barbara,overall
This is a wonderful story. I never thought I would enjoy a novel about life in a circus so when my friend recommended this book I was very sceptical. Even the title seemed a little strange. However I loved every page.  Go on. Read it. It's great.,overall
Sara Gruen's gorgeous new novel, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, unfolds as a dual narrative, alternating between Jacob Jankowski's life as a nonagenarian, and his time spent working for a ragtag Depression-era circus as a young man. The plot is captivating (I missed two meals because I didn't want to put the book down) and Gruen's writing, as always, is transcendent. She deftly evokes a fascinating period in American history that deserves to be revisited, and her characters--human and animal alike--will stay with you long after you turn the last page.,overall
Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  Couldn't put it down. This was one of the quickest reads I've had in a long time.  Well written and paced with alot of drama and humor that keeps you interested in the book.I could tell that this was written by an author that knows what she is doing and gives you just what you need to keep this book in hand.  Well done.,overall
I absolutely enjoyed this book from beginning to end!  A great story with memorable characters blended with true history. Highly recommend!,overall
I was looking for something different to read instead of my usual style of book and found this to be a great decision! The story was capturing and really gave you some interesting insights into the original traveling circus.,overall
I knew nothing of this story before I read this book. I haven't seen the movie so I went into this completely unbiased. It was Great !!!  The storyline and the details of this book are incredible.  Even though the story gets very sad and hopeless at times it is a wonderful book.  A must read !!!!!,overall
I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of this book. \A book about a circus? How good could that really be?\ I thought. It took awhile for me to get into it too. It wasn't that the beginning was boring or anything, it just took me a little while to get into the plot of the story. After I did though, I couldn't put it down. I lost sleep over the need to finish this book. Some parts I found surprisingly funny. It was an overall, all around good book.,overall
As usual, the book is so much better than the movie. A great novel, about relationships and finding who you are.,overall
I'd been hearing a lot of rave reviews of this book in the writer's groups that I'm in (ALL rave reviews, as a matter of fact) and when I heard that the movie was due out soon, I purchased the e-book now so that I could compare the book to the movie. There are so many great things about this book, when you put it all together, it was just one of the best books I've ever read.The point of view for Water for Elephants is unique. Jacob, the main character, comes to us first as a 90 (or is it 93?) year old man who is living in a seniors home. Most of the story is Jacob recalling his life with the circus, with short trips back to his here-and-now. I felt that I came to know all of Jacob. From his beginning, losing his parents in an accident, to his experience with the circus and his true love, to his last days feeling trapped in a body and mind that he wasn't free to control himself any longer.With the story being set in the 1930's and in the Depression, the book was even more interesting to read about days in that era. At the end of the book, the author describes all of her research that she's done for her book. It's obvious by how thoroughly and well written Water for Elephants is.I highly, HIGHLY recommend this book!!!,overall
Best book I've read in a while!!! A must read!!! Buy it! Trust me! It's fantastic!!!!! The only disappointment was that I finished it so fast (couldn't put it down), now, what will I read?? ;),overall
This book was soooooo good I cannot even put it into words without spoiling it for you!!! You will not be disappointed! I read this book in 2 days, when I wasn't reading it thats all I could think about! I HIGHLY suggest this book to anyone looking for a book with an EXCELLENT plot!!!!!,overall
What a GREAT book.  Never saw the movie until after and I am glad of that.  The book was amazing!!!,overall
Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down! Grabs you from the first page, and doesn't let go! A fast-moving read with lots of action, and no filler. It has love, romance, mystery, murder, animals and history. All while riding a circus train during the depression in 1931. Cutting deftly back and forth from the eyes of an elderly man residing in a nursing home, to the days he spent traveling with the train circuses in the 1930's, this story is gritty, realistic, fascinating and highly entertaining. You won't be disappointed.,overall
This took me to a different time and place than I've known before.  I felt like I was there.  The stress of the hard work, living conditions, lack of money and food, social hierachy, hidden relationships, and an ill schizophrenic fueled a desire for resolution.  That's what good books do.,overall
Did not care for the animal cruelty, other than that it was a sensual story with good characters.  I hate the circus but really enjoyed this book!  It starts off slow so give it some time.  I really enjoyed the perspectives between the narrator as a young and old man. I read it in 2 days.,overall
This is the first book I have read for a while that I read within days. I loved the end and how it flowed.,overall
Please read the book; ignore the movie. The book tells an amazing love story!! Take a few hours to learn about human and animal bonds,overall
I had first seen the movie and enjoyed it tremendously. Knowing that the books are far better than the movie, I read the book. I enjoyed the depth of the main character, Jacob, and the way the author interspersed his recollection of his circus days with the hassle of a nursing home. I was cheering his escape all along! A wonderful character, a great story.,overall
Water for Elephants should not be missed! It is a beautifully written story with a lot of heart and soul.  The prologue will completely captivate you and you will be hooked from page one!The story begins with a 90 year old, who also could be 93, he doesn't actually remember how old he is, named Jacob Jankowski. Jacob is your typical old man. He's seen too much in his life to give a crap what people say and think. From the first line Jacob spoke, I knew I loved him. He was sarcastic and funny, but also sad and lonely. His wife died a few years before, and his children and grandchildren only visit him in the nursing home for a few hours on Sunday. All Jacob has left are his memories of working for a circus when he was 23 years old (Rob Pattinson played young Jacob in the movie and it was wonderful having to picture him as Jacob. It was a beautiful sight!).At 23, Jacob is about to graduate veterinary school and go on to work for his father caring for animals. When his parents die in a car accident, he learns that his parents left him with no money and the bank repossessed their home (it takes place during the depression, and the Jankowski's were struggling along with everyone else). Jacob, having no where to turn, jumps unto a moving train and in this moment his life will change forever.Water for Elephants has an amazing cast of characters that all bring something to the story. Jacob meets the beautiful, Marlena, her charming, but sadistic husband, August, as well as many others that all shape Jacob's life one way or another. Even the animals play a huge role in his life!I think my favorite part of this story was the last few pages. Not because it was over, but everything came together so beautifully. We last see Jacob as his 90 or 93 year old self, and you will not be disappointed on how his life will turn out.Water for Elephants is a must read! I just hope the movie will do this amazing book justice!,overall
I've noticed that some have said they wanted to like this book due to the high praise others here have given it. I will try not to gush. But honestly, this is one of THE best books I have EVER read.From the beginning to the magnificent and most satisfying end, I was entirely delighted. Not every page was perfection I will admit but my annoyance was due to my own impatience about wanting to get back to a certain character rather than learning a bit more about another.It is quite clear from the moment you begin that the author did some seriously extensive research about the Depression era in general and circus life specifically.The way the author weaves the story between present day and older Jacob (at 90 or 93, he can't quite remember) and the flashbacks to the past (when Jacob was in his 20's) are fantastic. She handles aging and its inherent frustrations quite well, and Jacob is funny, endearing, and intensely likable.I enjoyed this novel so much, I immediately took it to my parent's and insisted they read it. Usually they stick to Nelson DeMille and Janet Evanovich novels (whom I also enjoy) so I knew this would be a little outside their comfort zone, but they humored me and read it. They both loved it! My father was as impressed as I at the ending, the satisfaction of it.They both commented that some of the nursing home scenes were depressing; Jacob discussing his failing memory or lack of motor skills. But I say again, the ending completely makes up for anything depressing in the home, at least for my family!Truly an amazing novel and I daresay, should be on the list of best books for the 21st century.  I read this book straight through, without stopping to sleep.Just an FYI, I actually HATE circuses. I find them tedious and beyond boring. NOT my sort of thing at all. Ugh. This book transcends all that.,overall
A different story from a different life. The characters seemed real. I was able to connect with all of them,overall
I saw both the movie and the book and I liked the book better.  The hype is worth the read and I would read the book again.  This was an easy and entertaining read.,overall
I found this book while perusing Amazon.com.  It is rare for me to find a book that is so entertaining but this one was.  I have never read any of the other books by this author, but she is excellent.  The book takes you into the time of the depression and you feel, smell and experience everything that the charachter is feeling.  The main charachter is in his nineties now, but we get to travel back in time through him, to this time in U.S. history and experience how a traveling circus worked back then.  It is such a richly written story, you will not want to put it down.  The desperation of the times, the way people lived, their expectations, their feelings, etc. are all here.  I have recommended this book to multiple friends, which I rarely do.  You will not be disappointed with this story.  There are no low points that drag.  It's a green light read from start to finish.  There is an authors note at the end, and she explains how she came up with the idea and her research to write this book depicting this time period and the circus era.  Although it is fiction, she got the facts first and melded it into this novel.  Very good indeed.,overall
This is one of those books that will stay with me for a long time.  It tells a good story (2 actually), it keeps the reader interested and it has a lovely ending.,overall
I loved this book.  I could not put it down, because I was in such suspense about what would happen next.  I particularly love the storyline of the character as an old man in a nursing home - having worked in nursing homes, the descriptions are spot on.  I laughed out loud at his antics, and cried when characters I had grown to love were lost to tragedy.  I have never read a book where an elephant is a main character and pivotal to the story.  All I can say is \WOW.\,overall
This book was fantastic.  I could hardly put it down.  No, it wasn't terribly deep, but it was a great lighter read.,overall
This was a book that I truly did not think I'd like. Not a big fan of circuses, I just didn't think it would interest me. Boy, was I ever wrong! This book thrust me into its story from the very first page, and left me wanting more. The ending is wonderful - perfect and satisfying. While I am very leary of any book that contains abuse to animals, I found that I could endure the occasional abuses described somehow. I was so completely enthralled by the characters of this book, and could see the whole story in my mind's eye as I read. The author does say in an interview that the elephant, Rosie, was based on a real elephant (two, actually) she discovered when doing the research for this book. I often felt like I needed a shower while reading the book because it is so atmospheric and real that I felt like I'd been riding on the train without a good wash! At the same time, I felt I was a resident of the nursing home depicted in the book and wanted to have a good meal myself.  Excellent book, one of the best reads of my adult life. It will definitely stay with me a long time.,overall
Water for Elephants is a great read that is sure to please fans of every genre !Come to Inkk reviews and check out our VIDEO REVIEW for Water for Elephants[...]click Review Archives then scroll down to WATER FOR ELEPHANTS !,overall
Normally this type of book isn't something I would read but after receiving a few recommendations I gave it a shot. I am so glad that I did. What a great story! You definitely get to feel an array of emotions reading this book. Anger, hurt, happiness. If you aren't sure you'd enjoy this book, I'd give it a try. You won't be disappointed.,overall
I'm not one to read historical pieces, mostly because I don't think I'll relate to the people and times, but this book is an exception. An exceptional exception! I loved \Water for Elephants.\ Tragedy, mystery, adventure, humor and romance -- this book has it all. This is the story of a young man who finds himself working as a veterinarian for a traveling circus during the Great Depression era, but it's really so much more. So, step right up, ladies and gentlemen, and enjoy this masterpiece!,overall
For me, this book reminded me of being a little kid.  I could picture myself sitting at the foot of my grandfather's bed as he told me stories of his youth and the adventures that came with it.  I was instantly transported to the 1930's and to the world of the traveling circus.  The author wrote with such clarity and viviid realism, that I was shocked when I later read that at the time she started writiing the novel, she has never been to a circus.  This novel is beautiful and moving, and certainly one that I will pass along to others.,overall
Great book I loved it and the way the author incorporated the old Jacob and the young Jacob was brilliant,overall
This story feels magical, while containing it's fair share of hard-hitting reality. It's a depression era story of a lost soul joining a traveling, American circus. It reads like a memoir of the story's main character, Jacob. The story begins in a modern day setting, where you meet Jacob as an elderly man, living in a retirement home.A circus is setting up just across the street from Jacob's retirement home, and the whole place is buzzing about it. It brings back Jacob's memories of his time traveling around the country with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. As a young man, he worked as their veterinarian.Jacob's relationships with the animals in the circus, as well as the crew members and performers are my favorite aspects of this novel. The author reveals that many of the most entertaining stories and plot twists concerning the animals were based on real occurrences. The author really did her homework, and it shows. The story line in endearing and entertaining.,overall
Water for Elephants had a slow start for me, but I was soon dragged into the story, full force. It is apparent that this is a fully researched tale by the author, and you become truly immersed in the time period, what it was like to be part of circus, and just how greatly and entertaining these shows were at the time.As an employee at an independent resident home, I greatly enjoyed the back and forth between the old and young Jacob.  The situations the elder Jacob went through while at the nursing home, were really poignant and beautifully written (albeit, sad). You really felt for Jacob, and it was a bird's-eye-view on what it is like to age as you feel the same mentally and yet your body betrays you, no longer being able to keep up with your needs and desires.The characters were really fleshed out, especially August.  Even Rosie seemed like an actual person herself. The interactions of Jacob with the animals were really touching, especially because a lot of it touched Jacob's inner monologue about many things but also of his passion for taking care of these creatures.The relationship between Jacob and Marlena rang true for me, and were a bit reminiscent of the two lead characters in Nicholas Sparks' \The Notebook,\ but BETTER!I absolutely adored the ending, it was whimsical and inspiring. There is nothing better than finishing a story and feeling content with the journey you just undertook. You will most assuredly feel this as you complete this novel.I would definitely recommend this all encompassing story. It's not a mere love story, but the chronicle of one person's life, love and his insistence on not resigning himself to growing \old.\,overall
I loved this book set during the depression in a third rate circus, The Benizini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  The book is told through the eyes of 90 (or 93) year old Jacob Jankowski, as he recounts the events of that fateful year of 1931.When Jacob Janowski's parents are killed in a car accident just before his graduation from Cornell veterinary school he runs away and somehow ends up working for the Benzini Brothers circus after they learn he is almost a doctor. The harshness of both the ever encompassing depression and circus life is brought vividly to life. We meet the side show `freaks', the stars, the roustabouts and rubes and come to care for many of them, especially Walter, the educated dwarf.  The story centers on Jacob and his falling in love with the beautiful star of the equestrian show, Marlena, who is married to the questionably sane August who is the animal trainer.  It also involves the wonderful elephant Rosie, who is brought in as the star of the menagerie, but seems to have her own ideas about that.The ending is incredibly poignant and brought a smile to my face, as it brought the whole story full circle. I really loved this book.,overall
I didn't think I&#34;d like the subject matter but I was wrong. The story and characters are so vividly portrayed that the story played out in my head with color and audio.,overall
Gruen is a wonderful author who not only captures the history of the circus but also captivates the reader in following the life of Jacob from youth to old age and provides a spirit lifting ending one will not likely forget.,overall
Water for Elephants is a wonderful book. The storyline is unique, and held my attention so much I needed to read the entire book at one sitting. It is an excellent book for book club readers!,overall
Best novel I've read in a VERY long time.  One of the few books I've ever read that I'll pick up and read a second, perhaps even third time.  Such great character and plot development, along with a few humorous and tragic surprises.  You can tell the author did a lot of research on the subject of the circus.  And the reflections of the 93 year old man are PRICELESS!  A must read for anyone wanting to read a fun story.,overall
Not sure what else to say, just a beautifully told story capturing the whole of the characters' charm, quirks and warts.,overall
I read this book with my book club and we enjoyed it very much. Lots of discussion material and I watched the movie, which was good as well.,overall
While I would not recommend this book to a young reader due to a couple pretty explicate scenes I would recommend it to any adult who just loves a good book.  Once I started reading it I could not put it down.  I hesitated reading it because I didn't think that the subject matter would be interesting, but I was so wrong.  This is a wonderfully written book.,overall
Very good read. Keeps you reading and learning about the circus trade as it was/is. Lots of human interest too.,overall
Really one of the best book's I've read. You'll remember this long after you've finished it.  Do yourself a favor and order it, you won't be sorry.,overall
My daughter has been asking me to read this book for years.  I resisted because I read the synopsis and thought \a story about a circus in the era of the great depression? Nah.\  I finally downloaded it and gave it a go and couldn't put the book down.  Seriously this is one of the best books I've read in years!  I felt like I was right there.  The narrative shifts back and forth between old Jacob and young Jacob seamlessly.  I strongly regret waiting so long to read this book.  And for you Nook/Kindle lovers, this book is only $5 to download.  I would have paid full price.  It is a haunting story and often had me thinking of my own aging.  What will it feel like to be inside a body that is old and doesn't function like it used to, yet the mind still feels young?  I can't wait for the movie to come out in April.,overall
This book is in my top five. i loved the character and all his struggles, i love how you can so easily fall into the character and see what he sees, in the home and in the circus.,overall
Great book.  Love to read but am an impatient reader.  If a book doesn't 'grab' me quickly - first two or three pages - I'm likely going to put the book down and may not pick it up.  This story reeled me in quickly and kept my interest and attention.,overall
This book draws you in from the first line and doesn't let you go until the last page.  Perfect, perfect, perfect!! This is my favorite book and is the BEST book I have ever read!,overall
I hesitated to pick up \New York Times Bestsellers\, because most of the time I don't fully understand the hype around them, either they're just a mediocre book or they fall extremely short of the hype that surrounds it, this was not the case with Water for Elephants. Sara Gruen literally places you in the middle of a 1920's traveling circus and dosen't drop you off until the very last page. I felt like I was right along side Jacob and Marlena and the rest of the Characters in the novel.The story was breath-taking, and captivating, and the characters and even the animals were so easy to like and so different in their roles and I loved it. This is one of the first historical fiction novels i've read in a long time, at least that come to mind, and although I was apprehensive to start this, i'm so happy I picked it up when I did. I'm really looking forward to seeing the movie adaptation of this as it is currently in theaters now, and as a true book-lover must read the novel before I go see the movie adaptation of it!! I have high expectations for this film so we will see what I think, but so far i've heard good things.Water for Elephants is an absolutly delightful story, it covers everything a truly remarkable novel should have; love, crime, secrets, drama, etc. this book has it all!flag,overall
Sara Gruen spent months researching circuses that traveled by trains and they paid off in the realistic Water for Elephants that she turned into fiction. The novel begins with main character Jacob Jankowski, a 93-year-old man in a nursing home, when the circus comes to town. This begins his flashback of his time with the Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth in the summer of 1931.While it focuses on the cirucs, the novel weaves back and forth between a 23-year-old Jacob on the circus and present-day Jacob with his nursing home struggles.Jacob had never intended to end up on the circus, but once he does he is caught in a whirlwind of romance and drama. He has to learn the ropes of a struggling circus that can't always afford to pay its employees. Each character has his/her own unique qualities that make each seem as real and relatable as the next. Even the circus's animals take on personalities that make them seem real.After the great reviews I wanted to give it a shot and I had trouble putting it down. The novel has a little something for every kind of reader as it falls into multiple genres of mystery, romance and adventure. Gruen continuously surprised me through the last page. Each page was as compelling as the next. I would absolutely recommend this novel to everyone.,overall
Oh how I loved this book! The story is told by its main character, Jacob who is now confined to a nursing home, reminiscing about his time spent in the circus. It tells of Jacob's life travelling in a circus during the Depression and of the harsh conditions for the workers in during this time. There are so many great characters in this novel that have great depth to them, including Rosie the Elephant. This is much more than a novel about the circus, it has a great story that everyone should do themselves a favour and read! I'm looking forward to seeing whether the movie can capture just what a truly captivating story this novel tells. Highly recommended.,overall
This book was an absolutely fantastic read. It is delicious and complex and gritty, with a fresh and intriguing storyline. The movie did not do it justice - they took an intelligent, R-rated book and turned it into a somewhat comedic PG-13 movie. You should definitely read the book before you even THINK about renting or buying the movie. It will definitely be a reading experience you won't soon forget.,overall
I bought a copy of this book at a local store. I found this story unique and adorable! An elderly man tells you about his life once he joins the circus. You follow him through meeting the love of his life, to being all alone. Amazing story! So much better than the movie!,overall
This book pulled me in from page 1 and never let go.It is riveting.This book was recommended to me becasue my grandparents traveled the Carni and Vaudeville circuit during the depression.I would recommend this book to everyone.I would have plowed right thru if not for work and sleep.Great character development and fast paced.Worthwhile read! Well written!\,overall
I loved the book. A well written story about circus life during the great depression.  Can't wait to see the movie.,overall
This book will not change your life.  You will know everything that is going to happen.  I learned a bit about early circus life.  I learned a bit about how Depression impacted families and choices.  The best part was the view from the patient on life in a nursing home.  Other than that, it was entirely pure pleasure.I don't even know exactly why I like this book so much- it was such an easy read, it almost felt like a Danielle Steele novel, but there was more to it- it truly felt like drinking a warm cup of cocoa on a cold night.I read the negative reviews because I couldn't figure out how someone could not like this book.If you are looking for a life altering literary experience this isn't it.  If you are looking for a nice summer read that is a bit more substantial than chick lit, this is a good choice.  We read it in our book group and to be honest, there wasn't a lot to discuss, despite the controversial topic of circuses and nursing homes.  It was more of a love fest of how nicely the book was written.I recommend it.,overall
Water for Elephants captures your heart from page one and you will not want this wonderful book to end!Wonderful flowing writing that brings the characters alive! You will cry, laugh, and cheer Rosie the Elephant at the end!If I could give this book 10 stars, I would. It would have to be rated in my top 10 favorite books ever read.,overall
I absolutely loved this book. The descriptions of the circus, the towns, and the train travel with all the animals seemed so authentic. However, I thought that canceling several shows and rushing west to buy an elephant and book someone for a sideshow seemed to be stretching things a bit. The expenses to feed all the animals and the employees would have been huge. I kept thinking this would have been handled by having either Big Al or one of his managers travel alone and make the transaction while the show went on back East. Other than that part, though, I was completely drawn in. I thought Jacob and Marlena made a wonderful couple. Marlena, by the time she met Jacob, already needed rescuing. And Jacob was a gentleman, who responded not only to her beauty and talent, but to her need for rescue. It's not surprising to me that they quickly fell for each other. My other favorite characters were Walter, a dwarf, and Rosie, the elephant.The circus part of the book was set in 1931, a time when people would take just about any job and put up with a lot of abuse to keep it if they had to. This helped to make some of the events more interesting and believable. The rest of the story is told by the 93-year-old Jacob and the author did a superb job of portraying the world from the point of view of someone who's in a care center and isn't always allowed to make his own choices. The switches back and forth between the two Jacobs were flawless and really help make the story. The ending was perfect, exactly what I would have wished for Jacob. Highly recommended.,overall
Ever want to run away and join a circus? Gruen brings her readers into this mysterious world and introduces them to unforgettable characters. Run away with her.,overall
If you're looking for a book that's entertaining and different, Water for Elephants is perfect.  The novel is about Jacob, a 93 year old man living in a nursing home evaluating his present condtion and reflecting on his past. Through flashback, he tells of his experiences as a caretaker and sometimes veterinarian of the animals of the Benzeni Brothers Circus. There is adventure, suspense, murder, and even a love story. While it is fiction, Gruen does an excellent job of researching the history of the circus which results in an interesting and insightful look into what it means to be a part of a traveling circus.,overall
The best book I've read in years...a must read for all!!!!!  Enjoyed the happy ending so rear these days,overall
This is one of the best books I've read in years.  It was incredibly refreshing.  I could smell the animals and the food and I could visualize everything so easily.  Jacob was fascinating and courageous.  I wept for him and I feared for him.  The circus came alive for me and what an ending!!!  Don't miss this fantastic read.,overall
Water for ElephantsSara GruenA 90-year-old man--or is he 93?--narrates the story of his one summer as a veterinarian with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth during the summer of 1931 in Depression-era America.  Jacob Jankowski resides in an assisted living home with other elderly people, many of whom require more medical attention than he.  He is quite mentally astute for his age, yet because of his age, most of the people in charge of the facility treat him as mentally incompetent, all but Rosemary, a forty-seven-year-old nurse, who treats him and the rest of the patients/residents with the loving care, dignity, and respect they deserve as human beings.  But she is moving away and will be quitting the facility, which in the end leads to Jacob's decision to continue his life--what little he may have left--in dignity.There is a circus that has come to town.  It is so close to the facility that the big tent and other goings on can be observed from the window.  All of the old people reminisce about their experiences in their youth going to the circus.  One old man and a newcomer to the home, Mr. Joseph McGuinty, who is considerably younger than Jacob, brags about having worked in a circus, carrying \water for elephants.\  Jacob becomes upset because he knows Mr. McGuinty is lying to attract the attention of the other residents; and the memories of the truth of his past life are triggered.Flashback to young Jacob Jankowski, a veterinary student at Cornell University in his last year!  Just before he is scheduled to take his final exams, after which he will graduate and receive his degree, both his parents are killed in an automobile accident.  After their burial and after learning the truth of his financial situation, Jacob is unable to focus.  He leaves the exam room and leaves Cornell.  Distraught, he leaves with only the clothes on his back and no money in his pocket.Because of the Depression, people were unable to pay for his father's services; and his father, also a veterinarian, worked for people even though they could not pay him, taking whatever they could give him--eggs, chickens, whatever they had.  Therefore, his parents had nothing to leave their son but debts.  To pay his tuition, the house had been mortgaged.So not being able to focus, he leaves without ever putting pen to paper.  Without aim or destination, he walks and soon finds himself beside the railroad tracks, when along comes a train.  Like a hobo, he hops the train with no idea where he is going.  He soon learns this is a circus train and is not tossed off it because the Benzini Brothers, whose circus it is, discover he is a veterinarian; and his services are badly needed.Working as a veterinarian that summer leads to all kinds of experiences, tantamount among them which are falling in love, getting married, and eventually working with the circus's one elephant.After his summer with the Benzini Brothers, he is hired by Ringling Brothers.  He, along with his wife and his growing family, spends seven years as a circus veterinarian.  He then becomes the veterinarian for the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago.  His seven years experience with exotic animals and his degree, in addition to bringing an elephant with him, insures him the job when the former vet suddenly dies.Jacob, ninety years old--or is he 93? he asks himself, recognizing that his old age has caused some memory loss--struggles to hold onto his humanity and his dignity as long as he can.  It is he who in his reminiscences about his circus life, his friendships, and his deep love for his wife narrates the story.  The reader falls in love with Jacob and develops an even greater love and respect for \old folks.\  Sara Gruen's novel awakens the reader to the often mistreatment of and disrespect for the elderly, evoking empathy in their cause.  Especially hurtful is seeing how their own families, their own children, mistreat them, or forget about them.  Old people are still human beings.  In many cases, their bodies may be broken, their hands and fingers gnarled, but in all cases, there is a brain inside their heads as Jacob proves.  In having Jacob tell his story in Water for Elephants, the author informs us of this and reminds us of the fact that we will grow old someday.  At the same time Sara Gruen affords us a moving and delightful read--so do not be misled by the title.,overall
I read this book before the movie had ever been filmed and despite the movie being a fail, especially after reading the book, it is still one of my favorite books. It is so well written and every single detail keeps you wanting more. I could not put this book down and it is such a shame the movie didn't depict the book the way it should have. This is truly a classic and a must read.,overall
One of my favorite books now. I devoured this book. Easy read and gets you hooked right away. I love historical fiction and now am reading all kinds of things about the circus during the early - mid 20th century.,overall
A wonderful, Must Read Book, an insight into a lost era. The Author is a master of the written work. The end is a tear jerk er and the story is a mover. Best of reading.,overall
This book was a SPLENDID, completely absorbing read!  I kept thinking I was reading a screenplay (although this didn't bother me, I did note it).Cornell-educated Jacob Jankowski looks back upon and retells the story of what became his unlikely life as a Circus Veterinarian. Sara Gruen makes the characters jump off the page in her writing.  There are villians, heroes, sequined angels, kind-hearted drunks, big hearted dwarves, and smart, quirky animals.  In all, a virtual smorgasboard of entertainment that transports you to another, fascinating day and time. Set during Prohibition, the circus train and its dark,frightening contents rumble from town to town holding the lives of hundreds of men, and us readers, in the balance!The only criticism I have (and this is very minor), is that I found myself skip-reading over the parts about Jacob in the nursing home.  While I valued being able to get this perspective, (and see that just because you are old and it may LOOK like you don't have all your faculties, you really do), I just couldn't stand but to get back to the main story.  I was chomping at the bit.Loved the book.  Loved the ending. Sad when it ended.  I should have made it last longer. Lots of fun!,overall
This is a light easy read that will transport you.  A very enjoyable read.  I tried reading other Sara Gruen books but they are not in the same league as Water for Elephants.,overall
One of the best books I have ever read.  The storyline and characters keep you captivated.  I highly recommend it!,overall
A+ in my opinion, this is the story of circus life in 1931, two years after the beginning of the Great Depression. Jacob has just lost both of his parents several days before his final exams to become a veterinarian. When he then tries to take his exams, he freezes, and walks out of the room, thereby not getting his degree, but still having his education. He almost accidentally falls into a job with a traveling circus. It's a rough and uncertain life, but he comes to love and care for the animals. On the other hand, he doesn't do so well with some of the people. From the author's notes, I would say this is a pretty good re-telling of what actually happened between people/people and people/animals, although this is a fictional work. I suggest you come out of your box, as I did with this book, and read something other than your usual norm, be it mysteries, romances, or science fiction. Oh, and you will love Rosie!,overall
Loved this book.  It was easy reading even though it jumped from present to the past.  Made you think you were right there with him working in a circus.,overall
I guess my age (82) allowed me to relate to many aspects of the story.  It was well written and believable,,overall
I wasn't sure about this - circus and elephants and all. I was afraid it was going to be about animal abuse and very sad. Well - there is that, but it's so much more than that. You'll be transported to a different time and a location most of us will never experience - the backdoor view of a circus. Each character is so real, I felt I could regonize them.  And although I wasn't even around when the story took place - at least the early part, I could picture everything right down to the smells and sounds! The author has a terrific grasp of aging as well. Sympathetic but not syrupy. The aged Jacob is quite a character as he struggles with the indignities associated with 'assisted' living and the recollections of a past - recollections that he was just now ready to reveal at age 90 or was that 93?,overall
Great read! Heard the movie was coming out for this book so I wanted to read it first. It's a fast read and I really enjoyed it. Hope the movie is as great as the book is.,overall
I started this book because it was affordable and I was thinking about seeing the movie.  What a great surprise! This book was funny, sad, and totally caught me I could not read fast enough. NOW I will see the movie.,overall
I loved this book and can't believe I didn't read it until now!  I laughed out loud and had moments I wanted to cry.  I loved the surprising end and recommend this book to anyone!  I even went out and bought it for my mom while I was still reading it on my Kindle!,overall
I recently finished reading Water for Elephants.  The historical elements in this novel were carefully researched which made for a thrilling book.  I loved the way the story was told by an elderly man living in a nursing home and it bounced back and forth between timelines.  You fell in love with the grumpy man and you think about what the elderly actually feel like when they are forced to live in places like this. His story is touching and you really get to know all of the characters.  The elephant is a sweetheart and it's amazing how smart she is.  Great book and look forward to seeing the movie to see how well it was done.,overall
Fell in love with the book from page one. The Author does a great job of developing the characters. She also made me fall in love with Edward Cullen (Jacob) all over again.. Definitely recommend this book.,overall
I couldn't wait to read and this book didn't disappoint.  The circus was an incredibly vivid background, as well as the life of Jacob as a senior in an old home.  The novel was well-researched and interesting!  The love affair was intense and problematic.  My bookclub of women 30-80+ all loved this book.,overall
I really enjoyed the book.  It was very easy to read and you can't put it down once you are started.,overall
What kid hasn't wanted to run away to the circus? I wanted to be an acrobat at one point, swigging around high up in the sky. I don't think I ever really considered the repercussions of such a life though-always moving around, having to live with who you work with weather you like it or not, constant work...now it sounds more hard than fun to me.But Jacob Jankowski never really had a choice in the matter. Emotionally wrecked and financially bereft when his parents die in the great depression, Jacob hops on a train and ends up in the middle of the Benzini Brothers most spectacular show on earth. With his status as a (not graduated but) Cornell trained Vet, Jacob is hired on to see to the shows animals.Its decent work, but hard. And Jacob's boss August only makes it harder with his mercurial temperament and his very beautiful wife, one of the circuses star performers-who might like Jacob a little too much. But it's an arrangement Joseph can live with-until Rosie comes along.Every circus needs an elephant right? And Rosie becomes Jacob's. As circus life becomes more and more perilous-Can Jacob get out with his friends, animals and possible love of his life alive and intact? Come to the show and find out?\Water for Elephants\ is a fantastic little gem of a book. The writing is marvelous, engaging, funny, sad-it's perfect really, except for one thing. And how could one fail to read the book after reading the prolog? There is no doubt this is an author to watch because she is going places!Just one problem-the disease that August is eventually unveiled as having is completely wrong for the symptoms he was exhibiting. I doubt the author really researched it or she would know that. It didn't bother me too much but for people who are suffering from or love those who really are paranoid schizophrenic it could be seen as stupid and offensive.But still, five stars.So step right up folks! Admission for this five star show is only the price of a good book.,overall
What a good book, characters were great!. It was a good read!Now I am going to rent the movie!,overall
A very well-written piece of literary fiction that is not easily forgotten.  I picked up the novel because of its great reviews and my disdain for the circus and inhumane treatment of circus animals, but ended up loving it because of a very engaging plot and my great affection for the main character in particular.  This novel is SO much more than a great story of Depression-era circus workers and performers; that simply lays the very interesting foundation. The ending was the best I've read in a long time and brought the novel full circle.  I look forward to more books by Sara Gruen!,overall
This book is a wonderful tale of life and of growing old.  It is touching and heart warming on so many different levels.  If you are ready to experience a full range of emotions from laughter to anger, from fear to surprise, this book will touch them all.Linda C. WrightAuthor, One Clown ShortOne Clown Short,overall
At times brutal and sad, at times hilariously funny, it was a terrific book and a fun book to read. I have recommended it to all my friends. The book had me captured within the first page and I didn't put it down until I was forced to, or until I got to the end.If you're looking for something that you can read fairly quickly and be greatly entertained, you need to read this book. It's more than well worth the time.,overall
Just finish reading this last night around 1 A.M.Good BookOne of those stories told by going back and forth between past and present. I love books written that way.Anyway the story is about a young veterinary student who falls into terrible misfortune and with few options joins a travelling circus, The (unscrupulous) Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.Time period is in the 1920's or 30's, during The Great Depression. Narrated by an old man, 90 or 93 he says. Who is (unhappily) living out his days at a nursing home. Ah but he wasn't always an old man.The book appears to have been carefully researched and many of the characters and incidents are based on actual people, animals and or occurrences in circus of times past.At times funny, sad, heartbreaking yet hopeful this one will stay with me for a long while. I highly recommend it.,overall
While I enjoyed the movie, there was no comparison to the book by Sara Gruen. I didn't want this book to end...,overall
I am going to make this short and sweet. I bought this for the kindle and really enjoyed it . If you are looking for an interesting book this is a good choice . Read it before the movie comes out,overall
Absolutely the best, most wonderful book.  I'd highly recommend it.  The story is wonderful and the ending is everything you'd want it to be.I'm telling everyone I know to read this book!,overall
I enjoyed this book.  While, at times, I skimmed through quickly over the more violent parts, the book, as a whole was very satisfying.  The technique of telling the story of the past while relating the events of the present was interesting too.  I liked the ending.,overall
This is one of the best books I've read in years.  It had excellent character development and I had to keep reminding myself that it was fiction.  Since hearing about the dreadful Hartford circus fire from my mother (who had friends perish), I have always found it to be such an interesting topic.  This bridged the gap from story to reality by referencing some of the real aspects of the circus by utilizing that backdrop with an interesting storyline.  I cannot wait until the next book!,overall
Well written and researched, the author descriptions are vivid and keep the reader unable to put it down. Highly recommended.,overall
This audiobook was so well done! Two different readers provide for the voices of the man at 93, living in a rest home and his 23 year old self in memory. Alternate chapters keep the reader torn between hearing the story of Jacob and his experiences with a circus during the depression and his later self coping with another type of depression as he deals with a worn out body and his limited life as he waits to die. Anyone with compassion for older people will find this story heart wrenching and enlightening at the same time. Excellent!,overall
This was a really good book with a suprise ending. A little different from the kind of book I usually read. I have given away a couple of copies and I've recommended it to lots of other friends.The story is about the early days working for the circus.,overall
This delightful novel, set in a circus, is worth the read. I was put off by the title for the longest time and when I finally realized it was about a circus, I picked it up. Boy am I glad. The movie will be out later this year so be sure to read the novel first. You will be glad you did.,overall
I loved this book. I read it before the movie came out, still have not seen the movie becasue I don't want to ruin such a good book. Very sweet.,overall
A story of circus life was not especially enticing, but my book club was reading this novel. I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the narrative. There is a little bit of something for everyone. Disappointment, joy, romance, a view of youth and of old age. Take a flyer and buy this book if you want a well written escape! Thanks!,overall
The last novel I read and reviewed was also about animals but this could not be more different and after struggling to get into the last one, I loved this from the minute I picked it up and found it to be an exceptional read. The authors love of animals and the tremendous research she did for this novel make it not only a fascinating portrayal of life, ugly and vibrant in the American circus of the 1930's but a beautiful and tender love story. I had never even heard of circus trains until I read this either and learning a little something when I read also appeals to me.The title had been on my wishlist for awhile so I was delighted to obtain a copy recently and wanted to get on with reading so that I can see the film, which has been recommended to me.Since seeing elephants up close in Thailand, I also have more understanding of just how intelligent they are. Wonderful creatures which will treat humans well if they are given the respect they deserve. Sara Gruen portrays the nature of the elephant perfectly, for me Rosie was the real protagonist of the novel. The novel is told as two separate but connected stories, as well as being immersed in the circus world, we are also given an inside view of a home for the elderly where the hero of the story Jacob is now living. Again the author has done her research as the scenes in the nursing home were poignant and all too familiar to me in many ways.When the novel starts Jacob Jankowski is in his nineties and living in a nursing home and the imminent arrival of the circus in town revives some very stirring memories for the old man and it is these that are told in the other storyline.It is the American Depression and when Jacob's parents die while he is studying veterinary science at university, he discovers that they were in dire financial difficulties and he cannot even afford to complete his studies. Confused and bewildered with no plans for his future he finds himself hitching a ride on a circus train and in that moment his whole life changes. By the following morning he finds himself working for the travelling circus and by that evening he has met and fallen for the woman who will for evermore be the love of his life. Marlena, the star performer, however the love should remain unrequited as she is married to August the strangely mad animal trainer. Of course it is not long either before he also meets my particular favourite, Rosie the elephant. Whilst struggling to survive in the world of this second rate travelling circus this young couples love overcomes obstacles that you can not begin to imagine.The two stories are ultimately woven together but to find out just how you will have to read for yourself. I highly recommend you read this if you have not already done so. I think most avid readers will find something they like about this one.,overall
The book is very accurate in depicting life in the great depression. I enjoyed the themes that were explored in the tale. Good read.,overall
this is easily the best book I've ever read and I've read thousands of books! You understand and get completely lost in the lives of these characters. it's an easy read and so easy to get lost in that you could easily forget your family unless they start screaming for food! lol. this was definitely a worthy book to read, no matter what type of books your into.,overall
What a wonderful read!  Sara Gruen draws you in immediately and keeps you engaged the entire book.  A talented writer and a wonderful story with characters that truly come to life!,overall
This is not normally the kind of book I would read.  I knew going in that it was going to be gritty and depressing;  what a shame it would have been If I kept letting that stop from reading this masterpeice.  It is going to be a while before I find another book as enchanting as this one.  I highly suggest you to give it a try,  I think it will be well worth it.,overall
This book will be one I read again and again. I have suggested it to many friends and they have all told me it's a new favorite to add to thier lists too.,overall
This book arrived in good time in good condition.  I love this story and couldn't put it down until I finished reading it,overall
A feast for the literary senses, Water for Elephants makes you feel the characters' hopes, fears, and dreams. Highly recommend!,overall
Old timey Circus stories are so interesting! I loved going as a kid, but I love hearing about the other side of the ring even more. Gary Jennings is an author that does an amazing job of researching and writing about post civil war circus life, so check him out (Spangle), but Water for Elephants is an engaging, interesting, horrifying and a \can't put it down\ read, for sure. I highly recommend!,overall
What a great book.  I am so glad I read a review on this book in the newspaper.  I could not put this book down - I grew so attached to the characters I did not want to finish the last chapter.  Read this book - You will love it!,overall
This book is a glimpse into circuses and carnivals of the past, in all their sordid glory. I was as fascinated with the circus life as I was with Jacob's story.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was fascinated with the book's description and became determined to read it. On an unexpected day off, I began reading and couldn't put it down. It has an unexpected depth.,overall
Great story.  Brings you right back the old days of the circus.  Interesting, exciting, dark and romantic all in one book! I even got my husband who never reads to listen to the audio and he loved it!,overall
after reading the book I bought the dvd  to see how they compare, i have not had time to watch it yet but, I am excited for a rainy day to come when I can kick back and ENJOY!,overall
Another one of those page turners!  Wanted to read for years, and it was worth the wait! Now I will watch the movie. The only natural progression, right?,overall
I was afraid I was not going to be able to relate to this book as it begins when Jacob is ninety, or nienty three.  I assumed it was going to be about dealing with age and death, and, boy, was I wrong!  As soon as I started this book, I could not put it down.  I love how it hops from old Jacob to young Jacob.  It has mystery, love, suspense, and death...just to name a few.  It was so much more than the \easy read\ I thought I picked up.  The characters had such depth, and you could truly feel their emotions. Who would have thought I would be so interested in the going-ons of circus life, but this book draws you in and makes you never want to leave the \big top\.,overall
Good read.  Makes you wonder.  Would like to tell more but don't want to ruin the story.  Interesting, from another thought and time.,overall
Great story, a fast read, you don't want to put it down. Sara Gruen is an excellent writer, she studies the topic and uses actual facts in her story. You really feel for the characters and the animals and are drawn into the story.,overall
Yes, this was a terrific book!  And I am sooo glad I read it!  (But reading it prevented me from going to the movie, which may have been a bit of visual/audio overload for me.),overall
This book sat on my bookshelf for over a year and I finally picked it up because i saw an ad about the movie. Now I am saying to myself, why did I wait so long to read this book.Water for Elephants was so visual to me and I constantly dreamed that I was with the characters on the train. I would get up thinking about the animals and what they needed for the day. I dreamed that I was under the big top. I also could not get out of my mind the thoughts that the main character had as an older man. The author did not hold anything back and I loved that this made the character so real to me. This book was definitely a part of me while reading it and I am sure it will stick with me for awhile.The story goes from the main character being an older man to him thinking about when he was younger and how he got involved with the circus. There is a love story that is so strong and so real.I would recommend this book to anyone.,overall
I could not put this book down.  Wish there was a sequel to this book.  Wonderful story. Now I want to see the movie.,overall
I have really enjoyed this book. It is well written. I would recommend this book to my friends and family.,overall
the novel had substance, you know, a plot.  Unpredictable.  Just when you think you might know what's going to happen next.  Intrique.  Sadness, hardship, joy.  Keeps you hoping things will work out -- of course, cannot tell whether they do or not -- a good, good read.,overall
I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Sara did a great job researching her subject and delighted me with characters that were believable.,overall
Water for Elephants is a thoroughly enjoyable read!!  I loved it and give it the maximum amount of stars.The uniquely quirky world of circuses and traveling sideshows is fascinating and Ms. Gruen brings it to life with a sweet 93-year-old character who takes us back and forth between the depression-era traveling circus of his past and the old folks' home of his present.  Feisty Jacob Jankowski remembers those days (and a certain elephant) with much love  You'll love his story too.,overall
You are very close to your parents and are planning on following in your father's footsteps, becoming a veternarian.  In fact you have completed your grad studies at one of the finest institutions of higher learning in the land and are prepared to sit for your finals.  Then you discover your parents were just killed in a freakish auto accident.  You are devastated, leave your immediate surroundings, if not your wits as well, and find yourself working as a vet in a broken down, \Greatest Show on Earth,\ circus wanna-be.This is the story of Jacob Jankowski, a prospective animal doctor, who tries to find himself after he experiences the worst possible news.  This phenomenal novel fluctuates between 93 year old Jacob's declining last years in a retirement home to his 3.5 month stint as a vet in a traveling circus during the Great Depression.You will not be able to put this book down as you travel back in time and discover Jacob's newly found existance as a member of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  His friends, Kinko the Clown (Walter), Camel, and others will sadden you as you explore their limited, fragmented lives.  While Jacob grows more cynical in those who callously control the lives of others he also learns about himself through his caretaking instincts involving an elephant named Rosie.  This relationship seals his beliefs that he needs to complete his final exams and secure the profession he was meant for.  In addition, he discovers the love of his life, Marlena, and how true happiness is found in his desire to protect and defend her.The ending of this book will both surprise you and leave you with a sense of fulfillment as you discover the kindness of othres.  5+ stars,overall
For me, this book was like making a dear friend, and then bidding him farewell. I tried to savor this story, but couldn't put it down either. I was so sad when I got to the last page and it was over.I think the other reviews cover the storyline well...and I'm not a fan of giving away endings, but in general, it has vivid character development, authentic to the period and circus era of the depression years... and despite some graphic scenes (which add to rather than take away), it was a great, great read.I suspect it will be hailed as one of summer 2008's top beach reads...and will be on my recommend list to anyone who will listen for a long time to come.,overall
Ms. Gruen is a fantastic author. Water for Elephants is beautifully written. It's almost hard to believe that this book is fiction! I don't want to spoil this book for other readers, just read it! You'll be done in two days, this novel is a page turner!,overall
This is a love story set in one of the most romantic of all institutions... the Circus.Sara Gruen chronicles life in the depths of the 1930's economic melt down. The protagonist's parents lost their $5000 life savings when their bank closed. As veterinarians, they accepted farm crops in lieu of cash.  Their orphaned son, Jacob, hops a train in the night only to discover it's a circus train.I would bet today's circuses have several vets on staff or continency... Uncle Al's circus doesn't have any, nor does it need a resume, certification or even a copy of a degree to bring one on board. If the horse survives, you have a job! The other employment practices of this circus are not so idyllic. In these times people stayed with Uncle Al merely for a meal.The author has chosen a great vehicle for the tale, a nongenerian who longs to return to the world where he fell in love.This story is simply and beautifully told. I see that it has been optioned for a film.  The content is great for both print and screen.,overall
One of the very best books I've ever read!  First watched the movie (also great) then decided if the movie was that great watching I better read the book! Excellent!,overall
I could not put this book down.  Maybe it's because I love history, and this novel is so very rich with it. Or maybe it's because I've always been a hopeless romantic, rooting for people who shouldn't be in love to find their happy ending.  Or maybe it's my penchant for heroes who are thrust into unfamiliar territory, in this case the circus world, and have to find their way.  Whatever...this book stayed with me long after I finished it, and that's the best kind of read of all.,overall
One of my absolute all-time favorites.  Not for the weak of stomach, but a great book that keeps you reading with many twists and turns!,overall
It was hard to put the book down.  The circus life way back was very interesting and fun to read about.,overall
This is one of my favorite books ever! It's the past, present and future of a man, his life in the circus and his love for a woman and an elephant called Rose.,overall
Filled up a two day train ride. A very worthwhile purchase. Lovely ending, GREAT as a gift to an avid reader....,overall
I have to confess that I only read the book because of the great reviews. I am not crazy about the circus, my childhood memories are made of bad smells and not so funny clowns. However this book is wonderful in every way I am deeply in love with the characters, the time period, and the animals...the best read this summer for me.,overall
I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could hardly put it down. I recommend this book to anyone who ever went to the circus and also those who never had the opportunity to see one.,overall
This novel is the best of all of my summer reading so far. I couldn't put it down and read the entire book in a day. I was absolutely captivated. Each incident, each character, the plot, the time-frame - every aspect of this book was simply amazing and I was even brought to tears twice.What a perfect setting. The Great Depression - the time when the great circus shows began to lose their prowess as the best kind of entertainment. But the Benzini Brothers circus isn't the fun, song-and-dance circus that everyone thinks of from movies like 'The Greatest Show on Earth', 'Merry Andrew' or even Disney's 'Dumbo'. This circus is a delight on the surface, but a nasty, dirty, dangerous and deadly place to be if you're not a performer. (And even some of the performers get the boot - like poor Walter the dwarf clown.)This kind of circus gives a taste of what spectators and boys who dream of running away to join the circus would never imagine.The method of Jacob's memoirs - alternating between his life now at 93 years old - still sharp minded and still having all of his teeth, stuck in a nursing home and feeling horribly depressed about it all, and remembering what happened during his time with the Benzini Brothers Circus - is an incredible technique. One minute I was drawn in by his angst of losing his parents, his home and his security to the point of jumping the next train to anywhere, and then suddenly, we are back in the nursing home, and poor Jacob is fighting with a fellow resident about the possibility of carrying water for elephants.Add the vulturous Uncle Al, the wicked ringmaster who'll stop at nothing to make his circus better than the Ringling Bros., the schizophrenic August, beautiful Marlena, a half-paralyzed drunk, a cranky dwarf and his little dog, Queenie, and an elephant who only understands Polish. The characters alone are enough to make you want to read before you even know half of what is going on.As I said, twice I was brought to tears - once by old Jacob in the nursing home, when he realizes that his five children had forgotten who was to take him on his outing, and he was actually brought to tears himself. I just couldn't help but think of my own 90 year old grandfather, who isn't in assisted living and drives himself and my grandmother to Florida every winter and goes bowling and plays shuffleboard every week. It was sad to think of poor Jacob, excited about getting to see the circus one last time, and then being terribly disappointed that his own children had forgotten. It made me feel like I will never let that happen to my grandfather.No one who reads this book will be disappointed. From cover to cover, it is absolutely wonderful. The writing style is simple and easy to understand. There is no 'filler' - unnecessary, boring descriptions or dialogue that has nothing to do with the story. It is an excellent novel and although I could rave some more about my favorite characters and my favorites scenes and so on, I will simply say that it is a must-read.,overall
I really enjoyed this book.  I ended up reading Gruen's The Ape House first, which I greatly disliked, and kept hearing WFE was so much better - I was not disappointed!  The story was solid, interesting, and well crafted, and the whole thing was just a very enjoyable read.  I'm looking forward to the film version as well.,overall
Loved this book.  Super detail about depression era circus life!  And modern day thoughts of nursing home resident!  Everyone should enjoy this book!,overall
This historic look at circus life was interesting and kept me reading for hours. I would highly recommended it for anyone.,overall
This book had a tiny bit of a slow start but once it got into the thick of things I couldn't put it down and I literally read the second half the book in a 2-hour timespan.  Such a great story I've made my husband (a veterinarian) promise me he'll read it!,overall
What a pleasure to have such a fascinating book  read to me by two great readers! The main character, a 93 year old man recounting his life is read by an actor whose rough, gravelly voice perfectly embodies the character. The main character, as a 23 year old, is read by a much younger actor. Together, these two readers turned this book into an unforgettable novel.Maybe the book is every bit as good as a read, but having had heard it on CD, that's the way I'd recommend you discover it, too!,overall
Loved the way it was written.  Loved the storyline.  Great ending.  Very good insight into the time of the Depression and the inner workings of a circus.,overall
I escaped in this book over the weekend.  Wonderfully written and instantly grabs your attention. I'll admit this isn't a book that I would have typically chosen to read but several co-workers recommended it.  So glad I purchased it and highly recommend it!,overall
I first saw the movie and loved it but wanted to read the book. I was not surprised to find the book was better.  the things that happen in the book were so much darker than the movie portrayed. this will be on my read again list!,overall
What can I say that the other 5 star reviewers haven't already?Nothing.Read the reviews.Buy this book.It's wonderful!,overall
Water for Elephants is a wonderful combination of history, romance and life in a circus. This was a fast read....I couldn't put it down. And the ending was a nice surprise.,overall
What a wonderful story! What great characters! Loved the backdrop of both the circus and the nursing home. I am amazed how Sara Gruen was able to put us there, experiencing both young Jacob's life, as well as 93 year old Jacob's world. Everyone I've talked to in the last week I've told them about this great book. Look forward to the movie this spring. I sure hope they're able to do it the justice it deserves!,overall
This has been one of my favorite books I have read in a long time and I really enjoyed reading every minute of it.,overall
Along with the Miracle Life of Edgar Mint, The Secret Life of Bee's, and Kite Runner; this is one of my favorite books.  I read it, gave it to my husband (who rarely reads a book)- he finished it in a week, and my 15 year old daughter - who finished it in a day.  We all really enjoyed it!  The way the author describes life in an old-folks home is hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time.  Even though it started with the end, we all found the book kept us wondering what would happen next!  Especially good for a book club!,overall
I loved this book from beginning to end. Along with some entertaining history, this is a beautifully woven tale.  To my mind, a good novel has unexpected twists and surprises .. and this book carried one beautiful surprise all the way through.This book stirred in me an affection for elephants that I hadn't felt since childhood.  Along with The Magician's Elephant by Kate DiCamillo, Water for Elephants helped to inspire the painting \The Gentle Somnambulist\ which is included in my bookTREASURE Twenty One Paintings and a Key.,overall
The characters were interesting and the circus storyline kept my attention throughout.  Learned some facts pertaining to a big top circus.,overall
Water For Elephants was an excellent book detailing what life was like for those who worked for the circus during the Depression era and later.  This wonderful story was told in flashback by a crotchety ninety-year old, man named, Jacob who lives in a nursing home.Other reviewers have already summarized the story very well. Therefore, I just want to add that I especially enjoyed Water For Elephants specifically because it was told from the perspective of an elderly individual who, in telling the circus-days story of his youth, also gave the reader a realistic perspective of aging.  For me, this was what made Sara Gruen's novel all the more compelling.For those who have elderly family in nursing homes, I would recommend that you read this book to your love one. I'm sure they will enjoy it as much as you!Maizie Lucille JamesJanuary 13, 2012,overall
These are the books I've been reading. Some were great while some were just okay! But all teach something. I love to read!,overall
I am truly enjoying this story. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a story with humor, heart break and history that you can't find in your typical fiction.,overall
This book was a wonderful story and left me with a bit of hope.  Even in the dark moments I could not turn away from it.  Lots of genuine characters that made me feel as though I could reach out and touch them at times.  It reminded me of circus visits and riding on elephants as a child with my face painted and a bag of cotton candy in hand!  Though I normally do not like historical novels I loved this one.,overall
I found myself yanked around a bit by what seemed like a formula fiction plot, with the protagonist frustrated from reaching his goal at every turn and the Bad Guy a bit of a caricature. In spite of this, I really enjoyed reading this book. The circus world setting, historical time, offbeat characters, foreign language twists, and starring role for an elephant, made it a page turner and a book I can readily recommend to others as a really fun read.,overall
I loved this story. About the circus. Not the sort of thing you usually find as a subject or background in a serious novel.  Characters are interestingly portrayed, and plot moves along quite quickly. This isn't Nobel Prize stuff, but a very enjoyable read.,overall
This was a fun interesting and at times, heart breaking story. Almost immediately after finishing the book, I missed the characters.,overall
As usual, much better than the movie. Hard to put down. A glimpse into a largely unknown world of the circus, with a lot of depth.,overall
An evocative page-turner. A wonderfully gripping life story, with 2 timelines blending beautifully. The 93(or 90)year-old and 20 year-old Jacob Jankowski both tell their tales, both ultimately centering on the circus.There is little to add to the many reviews, but I want to stand up and be counted as one more who found the book absolutely riveting and unforgettable. The writing is beautifully clear, and the episodes from the 2 timelines are interposed perfectly. Artfully done, Ms. Gruen!,overall
It was suggested to me that the book was better than the movie...which I loved!  But I couldn't put this book down!,overall
More than a vivid picture of early circus life. Wonderful characters both human and animal. Would love to read more from Sara gruen,overall
Downloaded quickly and easily to my device.  The story was far better than the movie!  Lots of detail, and an overall good read.,overall
What a great story teller Sara Gruen is!  Her use of narration and relaying events, like a traveling circus during the Depression, make this such a rich and captivating novel.  This novel was hard to put down and I often found myself thinking about Jacob, Marlena, Walter, Rosie and the many other colorful characters.  I found Jacob at 90 (or 93) funny and sharp.  I had worked in a nursing home through college so I found his behavior totally realistic, humorous and sad at the same time.  The younger Jacob's innocence, quixotic actions and love of the animal menagerie hook you right into the story and captures your imagination as you go through the Benzini Brothers Most Amazing Show.  This story of the travelling circus tragedy is amazingly well relayed.  I didn't want the story to end! So, imagine how ecstatic I was when I saw the audio book in our public library.  I guess I had not been read to enough as a child, so I found myself totally engrossed in this story, again, during my commute to work.  The readers' voices and intonations transported me to another time and place.  It felt like good radio of old (not that I come from that era, but I imagine people glued to their sets listening to latest adventure story).  Even though I knew the outcome of the story, I loved listening to it.  Water for Elephants was our last book club pick, and everyone enjoyed the story.  We all LOVED the ending, even if it is a bit unrealistic, it certainly connects well and mirrors the beginning with coming into the circus family.,overall
I've just started and I'm already enjoying it very much. Bought it because I'm waiting for a film to come out, with robert Pattinson in the leading role. I wasn't dissapointed! Great choice Rob! The book has an interesting style, touching storyline, and seems just very refreashing and quite original, it has gotten great critique reviews, too. Buy this book, you won't be dissapointed.,overall
Water for Elephants is a well-written, well-researched book regarding post-depression circuses and their people and animals.  the characters are fully developed, and i found myself rooting for some and booing for others.  i really didn't want this story to end; i have read it several times, and saw the movie (which followed the book pretty well).  i would recommend this book highly.,overall
Ever page held u right there waiting to see what next was going to happen in the day of a circus Plus a love story It had u wanting to watch the movie which I will be doing as soon as possible I really like the ending , better then dying in a old age place,overall
I loved the character of Jacob when he was ninety or ninety-three.  He has been there, done that as he reflects on his life on a depression era circus train.  When I think of Water for Elephants, I don't see 23 year old Jacob and Marlena and the circus gang, I see this old man who still stands up for his rights, mainly his right to live his life as he sees fit.  The whole story is developing this one character - You go 90-something-year-old Jacob - enjoy!!Rosemary was another character I enjoyed - so patient, so sincerely understanding.My main issue with the book - Water for Elephants - not the title I would have chosen.  A great title but I don't feel that the book reflected the significance needed for that name.  As I was reading, I kept expecting something to exhibit \Water for Elephants\ besides McGuinty.This read was chosen for my book club and what a fun book to plan a party around, would definitely recommend this book to friends, family and fellow book clubbers out there.,overall
Loved the story and style. I couldnt put the book down and finished it in a couple of days. Every page made for compelling reading. An easy book to read.,overall
This book have many interesting characters and kept you interested in their development.  It was an interesting time of depression and the importance of the trains.  I didn't know much about the life of a traveling circus but found the class system believable and interesting.Great ending.,overall
Nothing more satisfying than a novel with a pleasing ending, and this one does just that, it makes the reader feel content.The story is believable, has you cheering, despairing, and crying for the antagonist and protagonist,and can be thoroughly enjoyed by both men and women.The story takes the reader on a journey of a man who, in the midst of his veterinary college training, ends up hopping a circus train and changes his path dramatically.  It is told through the memory of the 90+ year old man who lived it and is recalling it from his current life in a nursing home.I rarely read books twice, but this is one I would revisit!,overall
The author gives a detailed, well-researched view of the life of the circus people.  The hierarchy is particularly interesting.  The photos really added to the book.My father is 90--or 93?--so Jacob's thoughts and fears were particulary heart-wrenching.  I loved the ending and wish a similar ending for every 90-something I know.,overall
I was so sad when I finished reading, I wanted to keep on reading!!! Great story, very fast read and very eay too! Enjoy!!,overall
Loved every minute of it, couldn't put it down, can't wait to see the movieI highly recommend it, you won't be disappointed!,overall
I'd never read anything by Sarah Gruen before and I'd heard a lot of hype about this book due to the release of the movie. I decided to hold off watching the film until I'd had a chance to see for myself how the book was.I'm so glad I waited.This book had me from it's opening pages all the way to the close. The descriptions of life in a traveling circus were gritty and made me feel as if I were really on that train, traveling with Jacob, Walter, and Camel. Ms. Gruen's character developments were also incredible, and as a writer myself, I found myself wishing I had one iota of her talent for bringing them to life so vividly.The story is well paced, with just hints from the elder Jacob as to how his life turned out. I liked the transition from old voice to young and felt as if I could \see\ the character both ways.All in all, a fantastic read!Nephilim,overall
I ordered this book for my kindle wireless the book was a great read I enjoyed it very much read it,overall
I had been waiting to read this for some time and our book club read it.  It arrived in a timely manner and in great condition for a used book!,overall
Very unique story about life in the circus.  Very well written with a great ending.,overall
I loved this book.  I'm especially drawn to the idea of a person in a nursing home looking back over his life.  It was well written and the circus life was interesting.  Great read!,overall
The story, the people and of course the animals...you will not want to put this down.....take the time....you will not be disappointed,overall
Very good book.,overall
I am still reading this book and can hardly put it down to go to bed at night!  I like a book that makes me turn off the TV to read which this one is doing for me.  I can't wait to finish and then watch the movie.  I do recommend this to others.,overall
I read this book in two days.  I couldn't put it down.  Very interesting characters and a great character study of the main character.  The ending will surprise you!,overall
I couldn't put this book down.  I loved it.  There was just such wonderful imagery!!  Great book.  Don't miss it.M. White,overall
Of the gazillion-billion books I've read in my lifetime, this currently ranks as #1.  I say currently because I'm allowing that I might come upon another book that bowled me over like this one did....I hope so....but I kind of doubt it.  Be forewarned...once you crack this book open, you will fall head over heels between the pages...and not want to come back out!,overall
There aren't too many books that both my husband and I find impossible to put down, but this was one. The combination of human drama, adventure and historical detail were extremely compelling. We absolutely loved this book.,overall
The setting is different and interesting - I learned a lot about the circus.  The characters and their relationships are also very intriguing.,overall
Romance, love, eccentricities, violence and humor are expertly woven into this novel.  I loved it and I was sorry to finish it.  It was one of those books which makes it difficult to begin another book.  I cared about the characters, and the events lingered after I completed it.  That is saying a lot about a book for me; I'm a voracious reader and I usually begin a new book as soon as I finish the last.  I think it is a book which would appeal to a wide range of readers',overall
I found the title intriguing. I wondered how many buckets of water an elephant drinks per day..I decided to read an excerpt and I discovered it is about an elderly man who recounts his experiences with the circus.I like how the author alternates between the elderly character of Jacob and the young Jacob.,overall
I hadn't watched the movie, but had heard that both that & the book were very good.  I had just finished reading a book & was looking for something else & decided to try it.  It was different than I thot it would be, but thourghly enjoyed it!!,overall
This book definitely is number one on my list of favorite books (and I read A LOT).  The story is gripping, beautiful and a little sad in some parts.  It's one of those books that you start reading then constantly stop in the middle of whatever you're doing to read \just one more chapter\.  The writer doesn't leave the reader hanging, wondering what happened to all of the characters but it's not a predictable ending.  Read this book, you will not regret it.,overall
I loved this book.  It is a great story that keeps you wanting more.  I had trouble putting it down.,overall
I listened to this book on CD in my car while driving across country.  It was beautiful and sad and funny and completely entertaining.  Made the hours on the road pass quickly.  I'm in the car a lot and listen to books while I drive and this book was abolutely my favorite.,overall
Based on the movie previews I had not interest in this book/story or the movie.  However my book club selected it and once I got past the first chapter I couldn't put it down.  It was such a colorful story - I didn't want it to end.  I saw the movie afterwards and it was equally as good.,overall
i love this book, just like everybody else did!!! i recommend this book to everyone!!,overall
As an avid reader and teacher I have many favorites, but this certainly is now in my top 5.  What a heartwarming story.  A must read for sure! What's even more exciting is, I just found out it is being made into a major motion picture! Looking forward to watching the movie and comparing.,overall
A wonderful tale of love and circus life, written beautifully. I was engaged throughout the entire book, and have read it several times since purchasing it.,overall
After seeing the movie I thought I would read the book. Not only was the detail greater, but it was also easier to get to know the characters. A very moving plotline.,overall
This book had such an intriguing story line that once I turned the last page I practially sliced open the cover thinking there had to be more. I learned so much about what went into running a circus, so much about performer life, and I realized not much has changed. I almost forgot I was reading a a story - I felt more like I was doing amazing research by myself.,overall
I put this item on my wishlist when it first came out because the premise sounded interesting and then I forgot about it until I saw it was released in paperback. I purchased it and was not let down. The story starts a little slow was you try to make sense of what is going on and whose exactly is this main character, but it takes off from there and I basically read the book in a day and some hours.  I highly recommend, as it really is a great story of time past and present.,overall
#42 Book Read in 2012Water for Elephants by Sara GruenI have put off reading this book for a while now because I was afraid that I would not be able to handle the way the animals were treated in it.  After a few friends read, they assured me that I would be able to handle it, so I added it to the reading list for a class I am teaching this summer.  Boy, am I glad that I did!Part of this book is set in a nursing home, where an elderly Jacob is living and waiting for his famiy to visit so they can bring him to the circus.  The majority of this book is set in a circus, a second rate circus who really wants to be Ringling Bros.  Jacob joins the circus and is considered their vet, even though he does not have his official degree from Cornell.  He meets the circus folk and instantly forms a love/hate relationship with August and an attraction relationship with August's wife, Marlena.Circus life is not easy and this book shows it.  Animals are treated as property and receive basic, minimum care.  There is a huge class distinction between workers and performers.  Money is given out in order of the caste system.  There are nice people like Walter, Earl and Greg.  There are evil people like Uncle Al.  The most despicable character in this book is August.  He abused his wife, his animals and his workers.  I was hoping for justice and felt satisfied with how August ends up.There is also some not so dark relationships in this book. Jacob and Marlena share a deep connection and they spend time together, even though it is forbidden.  Walter loves his dog Queenie.  Jacob has a connection with the animals, especially Bobo and Rosie.  Camel gets Jacob a job with the show.  There are good people in this book and readers will root for them.A difficult at times book to read, it was also powerful.  I recommend it.[...],overall
i just finished it and loved it! i thought the author told an amazing story, full of details. i never once lost interest. i'd definitely recommend this to anyone!,overall
Excellent old fashioned story telling at it's best! I enjoyed every minute of this book, from the first page. Gives you a peek into a life one rarely gets the chance to see or understand. The characters are very well developed and so very vulnerable and real. I kept forgetting this was a work of fiction. If you love a good bedtime story, this is for you. Real, raw human reality, quirky and FUN.,overall
I put off reading \Water for Elephants\ for a long time because I'd heard it was about a circus, and that topic held no interest for me. However, so many people recommended this book to me that I finally bought it, and once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down!This is a wonderful story about the dark side of working on a traveling circus during the Great Depression. The story is told in flashbacks by Jacob Jankowski, a former circus worker who is now in his early nineties and living in an assisted living facility. Jacob recalls the tragedies that led him to jump a train one night and end up working as the resident veterinarian for the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. There isn't really anything spectacular about working for a traveling circus, however, and this well-researched novels depicts the class issues between the performers and the workmen, the mistreatment of the animals, and the cruelty demonstrated by the show bosses. \Water for Elephants\ is also a touching love story revolving around Jacob and Marlena, a beautiful performer who is trapped in an ugly and abusive marriage with one of the circus bosses.I absolutely loved this book. It's a real page-turner filled with dynamic characters, vivid descriptions, comical moments, and terrible heartache. \Water for Elephants\ will have a place of honor in my bookcase for all time. I highly recommend this book to everyone!,overall
I picked up this book because I wanted to see the movie when it came out. I have yet to see the movie, but I couldn't make myself put this book down!,overall
For years, \A Prayer For Owen Meany\ was my favorite book.  Until I read \Water For Elephants\ for the first time.  I turned the last page and started all over again on page 1. I read it again after that.  I just love every sentence.  Jacob is a hoot!  The ending is the best ending ever!  Totally unexpected and totally true to character.  I live in Chicago, so the Chicago connection was one more sweet moment.  It's just such an all around loving, joyful book, with quirky surprises at every turn.  It made me laugh out loud.  I can't help it . . . I love everything about it.,overall
I finished Water For Elephants about 10 days ago and I can't stop thinking about it. I am quite a film fan and I often envision novels as a film, which to many purists is tantamount to blasphemy I suppose, but I cannot help it.  And I'm telling you this would make a terrific film. This is the first of Sara Gruen's novels that I have read, and as important as animals are to the story, I would venture to guess that Rosie the elephants importance in this novel is not near that of the role that the horses in her other novels have. In other words, this is not a book just for animal lovers, though being an animal lover can't hurt. This is  a revealing look at life in a Circus in the Depression era, and even more so a story full of fascinating characters and compelling relationships.  It is a page turner that I truly enjoyed from start to finish.  I am reminded of Thomas Berger's \Little Big Man\ when I look at the structure of this wonderful novel. As it moves back and forth seamlessly over a seventy year span.Sara Gruen writes an interesting afterword to the novel in which she reveals how she came up with the idea and the extensive research that she embarked on before completing her tale.  Her hard work paid off.  I really learned a lot about a milieu that I knew very little of prior to reading the book.  I cannot recommend this novel too highly.,overall
I purposely read Water for Elephants very slowly because I didn't want it to end. I thought the story was imaginative and magical, the characters vivid, and Gruen really brought the gritty 1930s circus atmosphere to life. I rarely re-read books, only because there are so many others to read, but this one I will re-read. One reviewer said it's just a notch above standard chick-lit, and I couldn't disagree more. This is literature. It's a fairy tale for grownups, and I mean that as high praise.,overall
I loved it... just hard to get started. Diff. from what i normally read. LOVED IT!! It was a quick read once i got started.,overall
A beautiful love story with a colorful and sometimes tragic backdrop.  It really keeps you involved and wanting more the whole time.,overall
Like Water for Elephants is a terrific work of art. I thought the characters and plot were well thought out and tied together nicely. I plan to put this one on my book club list, I can't wait to share it with my friends! You should do the same!,overall
This was an engaging story from start to finish. The author did a wonderful job telling Jacob Jankowski's story as an old man biding his time in an assisted living facility waiting to go to the circus, and as a young adult, who after finding himself homeless and parentless, jumps a circus train.I found the ending a bit surprising, but beautiful all the same. This was an easy read and something I couldn't put down. I love it when an author is truly able to bring you back to a time and place and make it so believable as Sara Gruen has done with Water for Elephants.Highly recommended.,overall
I gave the book 5 stars because I thought it was excellent. I had a hard time putting it down. It is very well written and very obvious that the author put a lot of time to researching the history of the circus. Haven't seen the movie but don't think it could be as good as the book.,overall
Water For Elephants is the story of ninety-something nursing home resident Jacob Jankowski, who reflects on the time he spent with the Benzini Brothers circus when he was in his early 20's during the Depression Era.  The story goes back and forth between those two periods of Jacob's life.  Old Jacob is clearly frustrated by the physical limitations of his aged body, and how small his world has become while living in the nursing home.  Young Jacob joins the circus due to circumstances in his home life that are beyond his control, and the story goes on to describe the events that occurred during the time that Jacob spent with the circus as the staff veterinarian.Sara Gruen writes with such rich detail.  The sights, sounds and images she portrays are all so vivid that while reading this, I felt that I was transported to another time and place.  I learned so much about what circus life was like during the 1930's, and how disposable both human and animal life were to the circus owners.  I was also very interested to learn that many of the happenings in the book are actually based on real-life events.  The characterizations of the animals were particularly well-written in this book, too.This book truly exceeded my expectations, and I am anxiously awaiting the release of the film!,overall
I must confess I was concerned about reading this book based on the negative reviews, but it was wonderful. I couldnt put it down. Engaging, exciting and fast paced.This is one book I would definitely say you should not pass up. I actually had this book loaned to me but after reading it, I must purchase it to add to my library.,overall
\Not sure how anyone could NOT give this 5 stars. Just a wonderful, brilliantly told story. I LOVED THIS BOOK! End Of!\,overall
Water for Elephants is the story of Jacob Jankowski who, at 90-something-years-old, relates through a series of flashbacks his life beginning with the tragic events that found him leaving college and joining the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth - a traveling circus. The book is heavily researched and that research shows in the detailed accounts of circus life during the Depression.I found everything about Water for Elephants interesting - from the details of circus life, to the sometimes disturbing treatment of animals, to the richly drawn and sometimes tragically flawed characters, to the story itself. This is not just a book about human relationships, but also about how some of us relate to animals as well. Even if you don't like circus stories, I think it's possible you'd still like this book.Water For Elephants is a passionate story of life and love. Because I dislike spoilers I don't want to give anything way, but I think it's safe - and spoiler-free - to say that Water for Elephants has maybe one of the best endings to a book I've ever read. I don't know if you've ever watched a movie and been so involved in the story and so content at the end that you wanted to applaud even though no one was there to appreciate your applause, but Sara Gruen made me want to applaud. Very highly recommended.,overall
I wanted to see how the book was different from the movie or vice versa.  The movie didnt focus much on uncle al from what i remember and the book sheds light on him and it was good to have that in the book. It was a very nice and pleasurable book to read.  Makes me want to look up old circus photos and history also.,overall
I can only compare this book to the movie Titanic.  The way it moved the audience, from the bittersweet past to the present, and from this we were hooked.  The main character, Jacob Jankowski, is extremely well written.  The story is a colorful works of his life, in his early 20's.  The Great Depression hits him particularly hard.  A student in Cornell University, in Veterinary School, his parents are killed in an accident.  Jacob drops out of school, unable to pay his way.  In his own world of sadness, he comes across a wacky, dangerous group of circus folk, who call themselves the Benzini Bros.  Jacob lands himself a position as a veterinarian.  We emotionally become entangled in Jacob's downward spiral and passionately wish him to find his way through these, well written, but dangerous group of people.  We watch as he hits his lowests points.  We see him hit poverty, then beaten, crying, bleeding, loved and even see him drunk and hungover.  He is truly a rarity in the literary world, and when I finished this book I felt as if I made a friend.  My favorite character is Rosie, a deeply loving, horribly abused elephant.  I actually had points in the book, where I placed the book down, and had to take a break, because I was becoming so enraged because of a character named August, who relentlessly beats Rosie.  Some of the scenes are brutal.  I rooted for her the entire book as you will too.  It's amazing how such a warm presence she was after the book was finished.  If you're looking for one of those well written classics.  This is it.  It'll have you laughing, it'll have you in tears, it'll have you wishing there were more chapters.  I have no doubt this book is destined for the big screen very soon.,overall
I just finished reading Water for Elephants and goose bumps cover my skin as I type this review. Now this is a good book! Immediately engrossed, I had a hard time putting it down as I read the story of Jacob Jankowski and his reminiscence of days with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth--otherwise known as a train circus in 1930's America.A talented writer and storyteller, Sara Gruen takes readers on a bumpy and tense train ride through history. This tale defines Americana. There is no evidence of author here--simply narrator telling the story from Jacob's perspective (is he 91 or 93 years old?). I liked everything about the book, but primarily it was the crafting I liked best about this reading experience.Seamlessly, Gruen weaves together the modern day voice of this old man, a Cornell-educated veterinarian, abandoned in a nursing home--a.k.a. assisted living facility--and his memories of three months spent as the accidental veterinarian on a traveling circus. Just before his final exams, he learns his parents have been killed in a car accident and this is what sets the story in motion. Once he hops aboard a train, which he soon learns is a circus train, he falls in love with a pink-sequined performer, Marlena, and battles her schizophrenic husband, August, who happens to be his boss. Jacob, a sensitive and innocent soul, is highly likeable and befriends most of the animals aboard. Most unforgettably is a \Polish\ elephant by the name of Rosie. But he also endears himself to his roommate, a dwarf named Walter, and a stowaway named Camel. One can't help but root for Jacob through the entire story. And to my complete delight, it comes to a surprising and very satisfying conclusion.This is an excellent novel and I give it my highest recommendation. Well done Sara Gruen!Michele Cozzens is the author of It's Not Your Mother's Bridge Club,overall
Fascinating, well-written story.  I could not put it down.  I have not seen the movie, but heard it does not measure up, as is the case with most movies based upon books.,overall
This book took to me a whole new world inside of me that I never knew existed. I became a part of the circus, the nursing home, a part of Jacob. I felt like I was with him, watching his experiences. It was truly one of the best books I have ever read!,overall
I got really attached the characters and found myself rooting them on.  Gives a whole new perspective of the circus.  I would recommend this book to anyone.,overall
This book suprised me. I did not expect much, but it has won awards.  So I tried reading it. What a pleasant suprise!! The writter draws you into the story in the first chapter. Circus and the Depression are not a topics I am usually interested. This book was great. The writter captured life in a nursing home. A old man and what his life was like prior to the nursing home. Amazing story and well told.,overall
I literally did not sleep last night due to being as o fully and thoroughly sucked into this book. Amazing,overall
This book captured my attention from the start. I love how the author melds the geriatric version of Jacob and the younger version so well. The narrator is in constant reflection and delves deep into the emotional states of almost all involved, including that of the animals. As the geriatric version of Jacob looks into the mirror, he can no longer recognize any part of himself. He tries to look beneath the sagging skin and bruising and still nothing. This lets us know what he is really missing and that it is what a person does, that defines them.  If you can no longer do the things you love, then who are you? As Jacob finally realizes what he really needs, we can more clearly see throughout his entire struggle, what kept him so drawn in and how relationships with strangers can be stronger than that of family. Perfect ending!,overall
I wasn't interested in this book by looking at the cover. It wasn't until I saw the preview for the movie, and the cast of characters, that I thought that I may be interested.  The book is NOTHING like what I was expecting.  It is an excellent story!  I especially enjoyed the narration from the main character from his nursing home.  It gave depth and perspective and revved up the ending!!!,overall
I really liked this book. It did make me sad the way they treated the animals but its a circus.  I thought this was a very easy book to read, and flowed really well.  I went and got the movie right after so I could compare the two!,overall
This is a most engaging story. I am still reading and have been captivated since the opening page. I took a chance and bought the first edition as well and am so happy I did. Theis work allows you into a very sheltered historical community which many of us has fantasized about but never imagined the speculated on the life from the inside perspective. Gruen writes with grace and compellingly. I can't recommend it enough.,overall
Jacob Jankowski leaves college where he studied to be a veterinarian after his both his parents die in a car crash. Unfortunately Jacob was unable to complete the test to obtain his veterinarian license. He hops on a train unknowing it is a circus train. Through the book, we see the different aspects of circus life, learn about the people whether they be workers or performers, the economics of the enterprise, insights to the animals and their training and how tough life was during and after the depression. Innovative story telling provides the reader with the past and the present merging for an emotional conclusion. The story awed me and the book was hard to put down.,overall
This book is really, really good. Well worth buying and reading. Wonderful story, very different. I highly recommend his story,overall
Get your tissue ready, and be ready for intense feelings!  I read this book MANY years ago, before the hype and reread it again with my book club.  It was worth a second read, so to have this book as your own is worth it!  There is mystery, magic, and injustice.  The charcters are strongly built, and the scenery is vivid.  If you are looking for more books like this one...check out The Dirty Parts of the Bible.  You won't be disappointed either.,overall
This book was really engaging, had good characters, good plot, interesting structure, and a good ending.  I have read books that have been very good and then the ending seems to be rushed, not thought out, or just plain awful.  Loved this book.,overall
What is a life worth? How do you judge if someone is worth saving? What does it mean to be human? What or who is really an animal? Why can an individual choose how to live but not how to die? Who has the power to answer these questions? How do you know that person is right?Hidden beneath this easy-to-read though dark coming of age romance is a novel that prompts the reader to ask the above through the reminiscing of protagonist Jacob Jankowski who is prisoner in fact to old age and in feeling to a nursing home. The story begins as the circus rolls into town and the flood of Jankowski's past full of pleasure, joy, love, hate, regret & guilt washes over him.Sara Gruen brings the Circus Culture of the mid 20th century to life through meticulous research, both the bright spot light and the grittier nature of transitory existence. Anyone who ever dreamed of running away to the big top or just dreamed of running away should read this book.,overall
Ok, well after reading the other reviews published mere hours ago i just couldn't help but put in my two cents worth!  Firstly i would like to recommend this book, because i really enjoyed it!  It has been a little while since i have read it, but it is a favourite of mine (and i would like to add that it is now ranked 62 in the top 100 list of my local bookshop! so hah!) and i thought it was really funny! (in a good way, that is!)I am totally confused by some of the recent reviews that talk about Jacobs morals, etc. blah blah blah.  I think these people should go back and read the whole book again because i really found Jacob to be a likeable character and think he was one of the few in circus who DID have morals and a conscience!Anyway, this book was moving, funny and incredibly interesting (i just found the whole circus idea really fascinating) and I'm not ashamed to admit that i loved this book!  Obviously as it got a 4 1/2 star rating from over a thousand reviews i am not alone... i really recommend this book if you like a story that is well written, original and not the norm! Great Reading!,overall
I'd like to think one day, when I have nothing else to do but read until my heart's content (which is probably impossible to do btw) I will re-read every book that has hit my favorites list. Honestly though with all the newly discovered titles, authors, backlists, series, etc I fear I'll never get to revisit my beloveds anytime soon. But when (and if) that day comes, Water for Elephants will be on that list!I've never really been a big circus fan - reading about them or attending them, but I liked the atmosphere of circus life of the 1930s. It is both beautiful and gritty in detail. After reading this I must read more Great Depression era books. I can't imagine how hard it was to live in that time period and I find it fascinating and frightening.Bouncing between young and old Jacob's POV was actually a great way to read the novel. I felt as if I was re-living Jacob's memories as he did, rather than being told a story.  Jacob is utterly honest and humble as a young man and it's hard not to like his character. Harsh reality is thrust upon him after he tragically loses his parents and is forced to find a way to survive without money or family. Normal life is hard but living life under the famous Benzini Brothers' big top is even harder. Despite elderly Jacob being extremely (and understandably) cranky (I probably wouldn't want to be around him - family or not) Gruen does a spectacular job portraying his life and state of mind at the assisted living facility.Gruen actually does a spectacular job at a lot of things. She delivers a cast of characters that become just as important to me as Jacob, Marlena, and even Rosie, the larger-than-life elephant that is supposed to save the Benzini Brothers show from biting the dust. The characters are really the hands-down winner for me in this story. But it certainly was coupled with some amazing story-telling.I think I didn't give this one a solid 5 stars because the ending didn't quite sit well with me. While I'm glad of the outcome for Jacob I felt the HEA was sort of - slapped on, for lack of a better term. Kind of like \Come on, let's hurry and wrap it up here\ ending...if that makes sense. It's happy (which made me happy; I happen to really like Jacob). Maybe a little too convenient for my tastes though. However, I have a hunch that if the ending were any different I'd still have a problem with it. Maybe I just didn't want Jacob's story to end *shrugs* ...Definitely a good thing about a book, if you ask me!As a side note I have not seen the movie adaptation but I want to. Nothing could really ruin the story for me but I'd hope the movie did some sort of justice to the book.**I received an eBook copy through AmazonPrime**,overall
I read this book only because it was on my book club list. I had passed it up many times in my search for a \good\ book to read. When it came time to read it for the book club I was not looking forward to it. All I can say now is WOW!!! I would have missed a great ride had I not been \forced\ to read this WONDERFUL story. By the end I was cheering! I have since recomended it to many people and they all have had the same reaction. This is a keeper!,overall
Water for Elephants took me by surprise. This book was really well-written. Not only does this author know how to tell a story, she educates the reader without making it unreadable. She seamlessly wove the main characters story around the unknown story of circus life during 1930s. She offers a glimpse of animal treatment, different types of jobs within and the classes that separate the workers, the expectations given by towns on entertainment, prohibition, etc. The research is evident and I welcomed and looked forward to it. The book does have romance but it has so much more depth so I read freely, not really anticipating the story between the hero and the heroine.Sara Gruen has made me a fan and has given me hope for modern writers.,overall
As always, the book is better than the movie, yet the movie was good, too! The author tells a first rate, unique story that had me laughing at various points. There were also points I was in tears. Am looking forward to see what Ms. Gruen writes next.,overall
This was my book club's book this month.  I don't always like what they pick, but I give each book 100 pages before giving up on it.  I liked this book immediately.The main character is in a nursing home and the story goes between his life there and his memories of his younger days when he worked for a circus.The imagery is excellent and you can feel the movement of the train as the author is describing the setup of the cars and where everyone rides.  You can smell the disinfectant in the nursing home when Jacob is there.I guess one of the reasons I liked this book is that I've never read something on this topic.  It was very interesting to learn about the different aspects of the circus and its struggle for survival.This is slower reading, you can't plow through it like one of those books you read on the beach, but you will enjoy every moment!,overall
This book is a near perfect read. I recommend it to everyone I know. And absolute must read!!,overall
I just finished Water for Elephants and could not put it down. I won't tell you why, but please read the prologue at the beginning of the book prior to starting the book.It was such a beautiful story. It was a subject that I never thought I would interested in but boy was I wrong! Read it...you will love it no matter what age you are!,overall
could not put this book down and read it in a couple of days. such a nice story. sad and happy both at the same time. you will enjoy it.,overall
I take issue when reviewers write extremely detailed reviews of excellent novels, such as this one, so I advise not to read all the long detailed ones here, and just take a chance with this book- you will not be disappointed!I am ashamed to admit that I saw this book in a few different bookstores under the \recommended reading\ sections/tables, but never purchased it since it didn't seem to interest me. It was only after it kept appearing on my personal \recommendations\ through Amazon.com that I decided to give it a shot, since the recommendations I get are usually pretty good. Thankfully I did, and was pleasantly surprised by how much I LOVED this novel!\Water For Elephants\ is truly a rare find- meticulously researched and beautifully written, it manages to educate the reader (about circus life, Depresssion-era America, etc) while at the same time captures your heart with stories of love and loss and the reality of growing old. I fell in love with the characters and the author's writing style and truly hope to read more of her work - she has such a natural gift!I HIGHLY recommend this novel to absolutely anyone - I think people of all ages, backgrounds and interests will find something in it to relate to and to learn from.,overall
An amazing journey filled with brutality, compassion, and love against the crazy backdrop of the circus life. Beautifully written. You will not be able to resist falling in love with Rosie.,overall
This book was beautifully written. I felt so connected to the characters and the descriptions made the characters that much more vivid in my mind.The content regarding animal cruelty was hard to read for me. I cried a few times as I read them.With that said, I think it is beautiful and honorable for these elephants to be acknowledged and their names remembered as their stories are further shared with the world.The details in the book regarding the workers and the environment of the circus were accurate and well portrayed.I felt a connection with all of the characters not just their Marlena and Jacob.,overall
I adore this book.  I love the characters and they are so well written as to visualize them.  I like the use of first person narration of the main character Jacob Jankowski.  It is interesting to go from the present to the past, and back.  It really integrates the progression of the character rather than a linear progression.  I read this book a couple of years ago, but reading it again, I found I couldn't exactly remember the outcome and was like reading it anew.  The character of Rosie is one of my favorites, inspite of the fact that she is an Elephant.  August is hard to take, yet one can see before it's revealed that he clearly is mentally unwell.  The tension of the triangular relationship was reminiscent of the trio in Sophies Choice.  Walter the clown and Camel are both very sympathetic characters, though Walter's true nature is revealed slowly from being a crusty, mean spirited person to one with great compassion.  The historical details of the depression era and circus life is so well drawn as to feel you have been working on a circus throughout this story.I highly recommend this book.,overall
Loved this book!  It was a reminder of my childhood experience in a small town when the circus came, with a definite look at the seedy side of the circus life.  The story was filled with the good and bad that exists in every element of society.  I loved the author's style of writing from the memory of a man in his 90's, which also gave the reader empathy for that stage of life.  Great ending as well!,overall
I loved this book.  It was very honest and doesn't hold anything back.  It really pulls you in.  Once you start reading, you can't seem to put it down.,overall
This book takes place back and forth from the great depression / present day. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and  the characters. I became so wrapped up in this book I had to tell all of my friends to read it and they more or less all agree with me when I say this was a great love story.,overall
Never thought that a book in this setting would be so riveting.  I'm so glad I read this.  I loved the characters and the build that she was able to achieve as the story progressed.  The love story was incredible and not with just humans.  The conflict escalated to keep the book going and it was a great mix.  The narrator stole my heart.  I might even read this book for a second time!,overall
I read this book in about a week and a half and I don't have much time to read. After the negative reviews, I was waiting for it to let me down but I never got there. I was interested through the whole thing and wanted to know what was going to happen next.I read it for a book club selection and was happy with the book. Not sure I want to see the movie depending on what I hear about the animal abuse. I don't think I could take it.Great read and I will recommend to others.,overall
I waited to watch the film until I read the novel.  What a great read.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and was disappointed to see it come to an end.,overall
What a gem! Really enjoyed this book... so much that I'm having a hard time picking my next book for fear it wont be as entertaining as this one was.,overall
I bought this book in September 2007. That means I had it in my drawer for almost five years and I just kept postponing reading it (I bought it along with many other books and it took me a while to read them all; then other books got on the way and so on).  When the movie came I refused to watch it knowing I should read the book first. And so I finally made up my mind and did it. It's a great book. I'm not a circus fan but the love story is precious. It was interesting to read about the Great Depression and how hard it was to make a living. I liked the pictures inside the book. I think they were a nice touch from the author. And of course I rented the movie and watched it after reading the book. Guess what? The book is better!,overall
I was given this book years ago. Looked at the cover and didnt feel compelled to read it.It sat on my bookcase for years.The movie came out and then the books were everywhere.So, i decided to read the first chapter and see what happened next.I finished this book in a day.It was such a unique story that was so touching and page-turning!This is a great read!That was the last time I judged a book by its cover.,overall
I never got to see the movie so decided to read the book. I had heard from another person that they didn't like it. But I don't listen to other reviews and I'm glad I didn't. I really enjoyed this book. It was entertaining, emotional and kept me guessing. Very well written.,overall
One of the greatest books that I have ever read. I have yet to see the movie, but I don't think that I will now; the book was too good.,overall
This is a great read, one you can devour---and I don't even like circuses. The reviews piqued my interest and Water for Elephants was even better than I expected. Pleasing on every level---prose style, plot, denouement. Actually you will probably guess part of the ending but it is ever so satisfying. I sat and thought about this one a long time after I finished reading.,overall
If you want to feel the sorrow and excitement of joining the circus and the sorrow of old age in our country, Ms. Gruen could not have crafted a better story.  The protagonist, a Polish vet student, of all things, joins the circus and therein begins the story of corrupt managment, the wonderful animals and the class system among the workers and the performers.  The reader is provided with historical information while the author paints a vivid picture of the circus train and its dynamics.  She interweaves a touching love story and a strong respect for circus animals, espcially Rosie, the elephant who only understood Polish commands! Read it - you won't be wasting your time.,overall
One published review of this book described it as a \romance between star-crossed lovers\ ... what an unengaged, superficial understatement that is!It's ever so much more. Among other things, it's a young man's coming-of-age; it's about a test of character and compassion in the demanding, cruel, carnival atmosphere of both the circus and the Great Depression, all accomplished while the death of the young man's parents is still fresh.You'll smell the blood & stench of the circus, feel the splinters of the train's floorboards, and breath dust as the musty tents slap bare ground at yet another town of rubes; you'll empathize with the rib-thin sadness of the (mostly) sweet, sweet, circus animals; you'll feel the protagonist's love, lust, pain, and anger as he makes the choices that allow him to become a man. You'll see these same qualities shine forth in the 90-year old (or is it 93-year old?) version of the man.I found it astounding that the author of his book is a woman. My experience of myself and my male friends as young men, and of my father as an old man in assisted living, ring true with the nuances embeded in this book. It's also evident that substantial research was necessary to give the book the authentic feel that it has. And not only does this book reverberate with atmosphere, heart, and passion; it's a good read! The pacing, plot and narrative make for a non-stop adventure. Highly recommended.,overall
Water for Elephants amazed me.  It was not at all what I expected.  I knew it was about a circus, and obviously for the title, an elephant was involved.  What I was not prepared for however, was the cruelty it showed.  And I don't doubt for a minute, that even though this was fiction, that these atrocities didn't happen in real circuses.We are introduced to a death in the prologue.  While it is fuzzy and hard to tell who's who, we are witnesses to a scene that the narrator, Jacob, has viewed and never forgotten. Mayhem abounds as we discover that the menagerie of a circus is on the stampede.We are then reintroduced to Jacob, many years later, as he is a resident at a nursing home.  He is ninety three, or ninety one, he can't keep it straight and a circus is in town and being set up within sight of the nursing home.  This causes him to reminisce about his time spent with the Benzini Brothers circus.As a runaway college student, after the death of his parents, he finds himself hopping a train that turns out to be part of the circus train.  There, instead of being thrown off, he is taken in by an older man named Camel who secures him a job with the circus mucking stalls, which later turns into a position as the circus's veterinarian.He falls in love with Marlena, the wife of his schizophrenic boss August.  While he keeps his love hidden, August, dangerous and unpredictable makes life tough for Jacob in the circus while in his better moments is a best friend to him.He also makes the acquaintance of Walter, a dwarf clown whom he bunks with and together they help Camel in his time of need.  He also makes an unlikely friend in Rosie, an elephant picked up from another failing circus whom he feels a bond with and devastation at her treatment from the cruel August.Throughout the book it cuts back and forth from Jacob at the nursing home, to his reminisces of the circus and its happenings.  One of the ending chapters recaps the prologue, only with more detail.Gruen does such a marvelous job on this book that you would believe she had traveled with a circus.  But she hadn't, all her knowledge came form extensive research and interviews.  The result is this novel, gritty and real and it keeps you at the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen.  Jacob's tale is one I could read over and over again.  By far this turned out to be one of my favorite books.  And the ending, well in hopes to get you reading this book, the ending was perfect and real fitting for such a wonderful tale.  Its well worth the read.Water For ElephantsPublished in 2006331 pages,overall
This paperback has sat on my bookshelf for two years and last week I finally got round to reading it - was I surprised! Quite simply, I found Water for Elephants an exceptional read and one that any reader should not miss. Briefly the novel is during the Depression in the USA and it recalls how a circus struggles to survive. The story is seen from the eyes of Jacob Jankowski, an unqualified vet who jumped on the Benzini Brothers circus train, one evening after the shocking death of his parents.The action in Water for Elephants is just right; more than sufficiently paced to keep the reader glued to the pages. There are flashbacks reverting back to the nursing home of the present-day, where Jacob is finding his aged infirmity unbearable, but somehow this only adds to the depth of the story.Sara Gruen has created a circus world that's believable; one that you feel right in the midst of and this is carried through with her characters.  Uncle Al, (the circus boss) and August, (the animal trainer) are characters you'll hate. Whereas Marlena, Kinko the Dwarf, and Camel are character's you'll love. Chief protagonist is Jacob Jankowski and I found myself completely empathising with him. His struggle to fit into circus life, gain acceptance from his peers and deal with the urges of his love interest, make him a hugely engaging character.I highly recommend this book. It's a gripping story and is one of those novels which will both shock and thrill you. The stark poverty of the early nineteen hundreds is interspersed with details of the emotional deprivation the main character, Jacob experiences in a nursing home during his latter years. Yet in both settings a light is shone on acts of kindness which define our humanity and reinforce the fragile dignity of those who are almost overwhelmed by their plights. There is a social history dimension to the story which enhances its value and impact. This is easily one of the better books I've ever read.,overall
Beautiful and enchanting tale set in a circus. Excellent story that is beautifully written and utterly absorbing. Highly enjoyable - recommend!,overall
I bought the audio of this and was enthralled and wouldnt get out of my car for two weeks.  I bought the book also, just to keep it.  An original premise, the work reads evenly and there was nothing that I didn't like about it.  Pleaded with Hollywood to make it into a movie, but probably won't watch it as I don't like the actors, as in my head Tom Hanks was the father.Anyway great book, don't hesitate.,overall
baby boomers beware, if you have an aging parent who brought you up on stories about the depression and a relative that joined the circus for work, or vice versa ( that should cover several million people) you will enjoy this book.it isn't about the circus, it isn't about aging, its about life and love.a truly beautiful book.,overall
great story,well written. I can't say anything about the circus parts but the nursing home parts were really close to home,and I about cried at some of that. highly recommended to read this book. loved it.,overall
I received an advance reader's copy of this book, and gave it to my neighbors to read. They thought it was ok, but no great shakes. But every bookseller I spoke to loved, loved this book. So I decided to read it. *I love this novel* and cannot put it down! Gruen really fleshes out the characters in this book. And what I especially enjoy is the strong sense of time and place she evokes, she recreates a real slice of Americana. Water for Elephants is set during the Depression, a time long before I was born. I feel as if I much better understand what life was like for Americans during this period, and the importance circuses played in providing some escape from people's otherwise desperate lives. And I feel as if I glimpsed what life is really like in a circus, behind the facade of magic and glamour. I heartily recommend this novel to anyone wanting a compelling read, even though there were some aspects of the plot that I could see coming from a long way off. The real photographs from Depression-era circuses included at the beginning of each chapter was a nice touch, as was the striking cover art. The ending could have been heartbreakingly sad, but it turned out to be uplifting, made me turn the last page with a sigh that I had finished this fairy tale. I highly recommend this book, now I know what all the bookseller buzz is about.,overall
I really liked this book!!! This is the first book I've read by S.Gruen. Now I'll probably try something else of hers.,overall
I read this book in a day. I simply could not put it down. It was so dark, with just a touch of goodness, which in itself was even complex. The love aspect of the story was so muddied, and heart wrenching, it made me feel for Jacob and for Marlena. How confusing it all was.Plus this story is based around a lifestyle we never hear about...a traveling circus. I loved Jacob, Marlena, and animals and even began to love Kinko.This book is by far a favorite, and so captivating.,overall
I thourghly enjoyed this book. The majority of the book about the young man in the travelling circus was a great adventure. And the parts with the old man in the rest home gave an interesting perspective. I highly recommend this book.,overall
The vivid descriptions of the characters and setting, the obvious depth of research the author did in order to write this book, the historic photos dispersed throughout the story, the fascinating plot, the seemless transfer between past and present, and the most satisfying ending makes this read one of the best I have encountered in a long time. I just could not put this book down. Amazing all around!,overall
Jacob Jankowski is just about through with veterinary school when fate switches things up a bit and turns his world upside down.  He decides to hop a train and ends up in the middle of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  The Great Depression was just in its early stages so for Jacob having a paying job was lucky but he also found parts of the circus life to be a living hell.  As he was just shy of his degree, Jacob ends up being put in charge of the menagerie, the starring animals of the show.He then meets Marlena, the beautiful equestrian act star who happens to be married to August, the twisted and manipulative animal trainer for the show.Uncle Al, the big boss of the Benzini Brothers, makes a habit of visiting other circus shows that fold and go under.  There he has his pick of their performers and animals.  It is at one such place that he picks up Rose, an untrainable elephant.  He hopes her to be the savior of this traveling show that struggles a bit to keep up with Ringling Brothers, the top of the line.  Jacob finds an instant connection with Rosie and the show and his life start to change.The book alternates between Jacobs time with the circus and his \present\ time where he is 90 (\or maybe 93\...as he can't quite remember) and in an assisted living home.  A circus has come to town and is visible out of the windows of the home.  No one knows Jacobs past at the home when a new resident comes along and claims he carried water for the elephants in the circus when he was younger.  This kind of woos the ladies and makes Jacob (who is much the curmudgeon by this time in his life) very upset and sets off a string of trouble for him at the home.The prologue when read at the beginning of the book very much drew me in to the story.  When the same story makes its appearance toward the end of the book it is amazingly powerful.  You'll just have to read it for yourself to truly see what I'm talking about.You can really tell that the author has a love of the circus and has done her research to bring the most accuracy she can to this tale.  I honestly thought when I heard about this book from everyone that it was really not my cup of tea.  I'm not one to just read love stories...I have to have some kind of conflict or suspense or something along those lines to keep my interest.  That being said, this book does not lack for anything.  It is really a great read and I would suggest giving it a shot even if you are having doubts about whether you will love it or not.  Fantastic read....hoping to see the movie and also hoping it will not let me down.,overall
I sampled this book because it's so popular and the price was right. The author's voice captured me with the authenticity of the elderly Jacob. Literally seconds after I finished reading the sample, I hit \buy now.\ One of the most brilliant techniques in the book, and my personal favorite, is the little jolt the author created every time the point of view switches from young Jacob to old Jacob, and it makes you flinch as though you too have been wrenched from the prime of your life into the body of a decrepit codger in a nursing home.The ending is perfect and satisfyingThe scenes depicting cruelty to animals were emotionally difficult to read, though. If that kind of thing bothers you, you may not enjoy the story.,overall
This just became My Number One most favorite story I have ever read in my life!!  period!!  And I have a gut feeling it always will be.,overall
KEEP ME SPELL BOUND TILL THE END. I WENT OUT AND GOT THE HER REST OF HER BOOKS. I WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE TOO.,overall
This is one of the best written books I have read in 2006, older people will certainly recognize some of their own life, and younger people should see a whole new view of their future.,overall
This is a beautifully written novel. I gave it to my dad two Christmases ago, and meant to borrow it for myself, but kept forgetting. I finally put it on hold (still in high demand) at my local library and had my chance at reading.The story wraps you up and brings you to it's world. It has been a little while since I read it, and I don't like giving out specifics, but I cannot find fault with this book.I highly recommend it b/c it will remain on your mind for weeks after reading it and you'll be glad you got to know the characters and their stories.,overall
This is a great book. I had seen the movie, so knew I had to read the book. I'm loving using my kindle!,overall
What an interesting and enjoyable book to read. It was heart wrenching at times, especially the way the animals were treated. But it really opened my eyes as to why so many folks don't think that animals should be made to perform in the circus. Great read.,overall
Great book. Could not put it down once I started reading it. After I finished it, my husband read it and enjoyed it as much as I did.,overall
This was the best book I've read in a while.  My 89 yr. old father lives in an assisted living and I know he has many of the same feelings as Jacob.  I was fascinated by the lives of those working in a traveling circus and loved how the entire story unfolded.  I will suggest this one to my book club.,overall
I absolutely love this book.  It's something you can read over and over.  I recommend it to any one who wants to live a great love story.,overall
I gave this high marks.  Great story.  Was fresh and held my attention,well written. I couldn't wait to get back to it when I put it down.  Thank you,overall
It doesn't happen often where you are just reading a book for the shear beauty of the writing. Water for Elephants may just be that book.There isn't anything truly original about the story but there is something inspired in the creation of her characters and the telling of the story.The beauty of Gruen's prose had me turning pages without a care in the world.,overall
Water for Elephants is an unusual story that I found captivating and difficult to put down.  The story is well written and provides a glimpse into circus life and the cruel times during the early years in the twentieth century.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fast paced story that is a wee bit like Grapes of Wrath but less dark.,overall
An easy and enjoyable read. A interesting look into an unusual way of life. Highly recommend. I'll check out her other books.,overall
This book was such a fabulous read.  I literally felt as if I was part of the circus.  A very charming tale.  Totally recommend.,overall
A very good read!  The story as related by Jacob, alternated between the present when he's already 90 or 93 and during the 1930s when he was 23 and traveling with the circus.  It talked about loss, love, friendship (odd and otherwise), fellowship, family.  The book is full of so much emotion that even if I have not been to a circus all my life, and given that I am a woman, I was able to transport myself into Jacob's mind, and feel the story.  I just wish there was more to read after the old Jacob got himself into the circus \train\ again.,overall
Water For Elephants has to be the best novel I've read in a long time.  I read all the time and I rarely read a book that I don't like but this book has to go to the top of the list right up there with The Lord of the Rings and Anna Karenina.  I had been told by several people what a phenomenal story it was for some time and I decided to make it one of my summer reads since it is hard for me to really get into books during the rest of the year (I teach).  One of my students was reading it in May and told me how great it was.  I refused to allow her to tell me anything about it because I was determined to read it as soon as summer began.  It took me a while but I am so glad I finally got around to it.This is a book that is easy to read and really pulls you into the story.  It reminded me of the film Titanic in terms of characters.  I have to say that if you are looking for a book that is truly engaging and pulls at every emotion you've got then don't wait any longer. Read this novel and enjoy!  I didn't want it to end and I can't wait to see how the film is compared to the book.  Only a few novels I've read really stick with me for life and this one is one of them.  You will not regret reading Water For Elephants by Sara Gruen.,overall
This book is an absolute must read. I would literally read faster just so I could get more of it read before I had to stop. You constantly want to know what's going to happen next. You feel like you be one a part of the story and you root for your favorite characters to make  it.,overall
Growing up I was not a fan of the circus, so I was hesitant in trying this book.  Boy was I surprised.  The characters are engaging and the plot was interesting.  I learned a lot more about circus life and realize my feelings about circuses were justified.,overall
This book was so great to curl up and read during the winter months! It was written beautifully and the descriptions are so vivid! You will not be disappointed!,overall
I'm going to stop writing reviews if you keep making me write a certain number of words for it to be valid.,overall
I think this is one of the first books I've given a five star rating since I started my blog. Quite honestly, the goodreads synopses does the book no justice because what this book is-is no less than amazing. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but mine happens to be that this is one of my all time favorite books. My compairison to the movie almost ruined the book for me, but I'm glad that I was able to get past it.The beginning of the book is very misleading, and it really made me dislike Marlena, the leading lady of this books. It is Marlena who begins an affair with Jacob, our hero, only they don't sleep together until its already been assumed by other people that they were indeed together. I did not like her one bit until the end.One of the most charming aspects of this book is how it flips between young Jacob as he works on the circus with the animals and then back again to him, 90 or 93 (he's not quite sure). I thought that the switch between the two worlds is great because on one side you see this young man who has his whole life ahead of him and then you see where he is today.I loved when he talked about the animals and how he took care of them. Once he mentioned that he was a vet student, you can tell that he is going to work in the capacity of vet to the animals. I hated how the animals were mistreated by August, especially Rosie, who was the lovable elephant. Although Rosie seems stupid, she proves to be a lot smarter than anyone thought.Most of the characters have redeeming qualities that, although they are rough around the edges, you can't help but feel for them. Walter and Camel, Jacob's two bunkmates are no exception to that characterization. Walter- a midget clown and his dog Queenie, are very mean at the start until a prank makes Water soften up on the new guy. Camel was the one that helped to get Jacob a job on the circus to begin with.What made the book for me was also the ending, and although you can interpret it two ways, I chose to see it as an old man who isn't ready to settle down into a nursing home and so instead he moves forward with his life on board with another circus.,overall
I was amazed, surprised, and entertained while reading this book, who ever thought about life in a traveling circus! not me that's for sure. Along the entertainment value, the facts, the history, the research was superb.I look forward the movie, even the author and her family will have a cameo.,overall
Loved the main character Jacob. Have to watch the movie again, but definitely don't remember this ending. Loved the author interview at the end also, so insightful as to how and why she wrote this book. Definitely have and will recommend.,overall
This was a beautiful book with a sweet ending. Definitely some beauty in the memories the main character reminisced on and the reader can get hooked.,overall
I saw the preview for the movie and decided I would like to read it  before I watched and I must say the book was better!! Gruen  grasps  your  attention from the first page til the very end of it.. I would definitely recommend reading the book i enjoyed it thoroughly and  will definitely  be looking  for more  by Gruen!,overall
Water for Elephants is an interesting look into train circuses of the early 20th century. It will captivate you from the beginning and hold you through to the end.,overall
I really learned a lot about the circus, the good and bad parts, and have such a great appreciation of all of the work that goes on behind the scenes.  Plus, giving the characters a &#34;real&#34; life and personality, made it all the more interesting.  I loved Rosie, the elephant - such &#34;humanness&#34; in her attitude and loving nature.  I liked the way, as an old man, he was able to reflect and recall his vivid youth working in the circus.,overall
Jacob Jankowski is a student at Cornell Veterinarian School.  He gets the heart-breaking news that his parents have died in a car crash.  In the throes of the great depression, Jacob finds out there is nothing left of their estate.  He tries to finish his exams but cannot.  Jacob takes the next train out of town.  Inadvertently, he finds himself on the Benzini Brothers Circus train.  Jacob is hired on and becomes immersed in the circus life.  He also falls in love with Marlena, one of the star performers married to August, the equestrian trainer.  Jacob is telling his story some 70 years later as a 93 year old patient in a nursing home.  Present day happenings are interspersed with his memories of life back in '31.  The circus chapters start with historical photographs lending to the authenticity of events.  Mesmerizing writing, fascinating characters, and actual documented circus events combine to make this an exceptional novel to enjoy!,overall
I avoided reading this book for a long time because I feared it was over rated- I was wrong.  Well worth the read. Good story, easily connected to the characters - loved every minute of it.For those who compared this book to HBOs series Carnival - very very wrong.... general story, the characters, theme - nothing the same. I was an avid watcher of the 'Carnival', the whole black magic thing- loved it. 'Water for Elephants' has none of that.  Comparing the two stories would be like comparing movies 'The Hangover' and the HBO series 'Empire Boardwalk' and the common trait is they both have gambling and take place in a gambling city (not event he same city).  'Carnival' and 'Water for Elephants' only common thread is that take place in the same time in history and based on traveling entertainers (not even the same type of traveling groups).My big regret is not finishing the book before they announced the movie and who was playing the characters - but that's not the books fault.,overall
When someone recommended this book to me I thought they said Waterford Elephants.  I thought it might be about China collectible elephants.  Seriously though, this book was fabulous.  I couldn't put the book down.,overall
As avid readers there are times when we are apt to encounter books that continue and linger in our minds once read.  For me, \Water for Elephants\ was a serendipitous find and I truly and lovingly enjoyed this novel.  It's one of those books that you never want to end.  There is reason why this book has been on the NY Times bestseller list for more than 12 consecutive weeks.  As many reviewers have already recounted the summary I will simply say just READ IT!  I promise you will be searching for more of Sara Gruen's novels.  BTW, Apehouse is the next novel to be released!,overall
I would have never believed that I would have enjoyed this book. Let alone enjoyed it to the extreme level which I did. A well respected friend recommended this book to me so I pull it up online and read the synopsis. Well, the synopsis and subject matter regarding circus life in the mid 1900's did not interest me in the least bit. Suffice to say I did not immediately read it. Only after subsequent prompting from my friend did I agree to give it a shot. That turned out to be an EXCELLENT idea. It was clear and concise reading that gave me vivid images of that era and written with short chapters that propelled me along to read just a little more each time since I was skeptical from the start. The story recounted through the eyes of an old man reminiscing his youth was pulled off seamlessly. It was like reading two stories. Now, after reading the book for myself I'm amazed at the few negative reviewer's comments. I'm reminded that some people complain about everything.,overall
Water for Elephants is a love story. Love between a man and a woman; love between humans and animals; and people's love of circuses. All these sub-stories coalesce into one that is set at the time of the Great Depression to make up the background of this book.The book starts with a horrendous scene in which the circus's animals stampede and a murder takes place. A man's head is split open by a big stake. The next chapter is in the nursing home where we get to meet a 90+ year old man named Jacob who is in a nursing home. Jacob is lucid and his mind is still sharp and he comments on the other residents of the nursing home who are much further along the path of dementia and senility. The rest of the book bounces around between Jacob in the nursing home, and Jacob as the brand-new minted veterinarian.Putting the story in a time line, Jacob is about set to graduate from the Cornell Veterinary School when a tragic accident kills his parents. He is an only child and it turns out that his parents took all of their savings and a mortgage out on their house to be able to afford to send him to Cornell. When they die, there is nothing left for him so he returns to Cornell to sit for his final exams. His mind is not on schooling and he ends up leaving the school and wanders down the road. It's not long before he decides to hop on a train that is travelling by and this gets him introduced into the world of the circus as it just happens to be a circus train that he jumps on.Being the time of the Great Depression, there is a chance that he will get thrown directly off the train as a hobo but he manages to make some friends among the crowd of laborers and they get him accepted as another laborer on the circus until it is discovered that he is almost a veterinarian. For the circus owner, that is close enough and Jacob is now the circus's vet. Now he moves up in the world and is allowed to travel in a train car with performers and meets the love of his life amongst them. He also meets up with animals that he treats with empathy and kindness - and they respond with friendship.He also meets with some of the more zany and crazy people who inhabit that world and none of them are necessarily nice. There is a crazy horse trainer; violent security men; \patch men\ who clean up the inevitable problems and messes that take place; and, of course, the associated laborers and hangers-on who populate the world. Jacob deals with them all in his own way and the story develops in a relatively predictable manner. It is no surprise that the animals respond to Jacob's kindness in kind and find ways to get back at the people who treat them badly. There are numerous anecdotes sprinkled throughout the book culled from the rich history of the circus world - things like the Lemonade Thief; the Animal who only understands Polish; and the less than legal activities that surrounded the circus.The climax of the story is presented in the first chapter - the murder. There is no real mystery there - we know who will get murdered right after the first meeting with the man. What is left in doubt is who did the killing. That is resolved in a very satisfying way at the end of the book.However, there is another storyline here too. The old Jacob finds out that a circus is coming to perform outside his nursing home and he would dearly like to go back to the world that he left 60-odd years before - if only for a visit. But, wouldn't you know it - that happens to be the week that his family forgets to come visit him in the nursing home. The twist that the author puts in at this point is brilliant and brings the whole book to a double satisfying ending which proves that once you are involved in a world that you really like, you never really leave it.This was overall a very fun book to read. Being an animal lover, I really appreciated the insights into the world of the exotic - and not so exotic - animals provided. Of course, the whole glimpse into the world of circus life was also interesting. About the only negative thing I have to say about the book is its almost obsessive fascination with human sexuality. There is almost no single chapter that does not have a sex scene in it and it is not clear to me how most of them contribute to the overall story line. In other words, I would not give this story to your younger children to read, but, aside from that one quibble, this is a good read.,overall
The way the story went from present to past was interesting. The circus details were fascinating. The ending was charming. I really enjoyed reading this book.,overall
This book is great. I was only reading it on my way to school and back. I don't know how many times I missed my stop because I was so into the book itself. This book is great, easy to read and really makes you feel like your there. The details and the way it's written are excellent...time to watch the movie. Let's hope it's half as good as the book.,overall
Loved this book.  I'd seen it around since it came out, but hadn't read it.  So glad I finally got around to it!  I didn't want the book to end - I was so disappointed as the pages decreased and I was nearing the end.  Loved it.,overall
How many novels have you read about the circus? This was certainly my first and that's what I loved about it - it was something out of the ordinary. The story flowed smoothly and was full of great stories. I read a review stating that the characters weren't realistic, August was too horrid and Jacob was a coward. I definitely disagree and found most, if not all, the characters to be believable.My only complaint is the vocabulary in the novel. It seemed the author was going out of her way to use synonyms fairly close together within the plot. While I don't mind challenges to my vocabulary I didn't find it believable as if the story was really told from one person's point of view it is doubtful that they would use such extreme variety in word choices. This is nit-picking though, overall I really enjoyed the journey!,overall
What a thoroughly engrossing book! I plan to buy gift copies for friends and family since it was THAT different from the normal 'whodunit'!,overall
This book was a wonderful read, drawing you in, making you part of the story.  THAT is what makes a great book, when you are there, you are wrapped up in the characters, loving the good guys and hating the bad guys, feeling it all, as you lose yourself in a well written book such as this one.  I highly recommend this book!,overall
This is the kind of story a grandpa would tell over and over again. I did not buy the book but I wish I had. And for only $4 on the kindle, it's a steal! I cannot wait to see the movie. The best part is that this is just one story of the old man's life. And I would like to hear more! It will keep you turning pages until there are no more to turn!,overall
I didn't think I would like this novel as it was what I thought was a book about the Circus. I was way wrong. The characters that were developed were terrific and the imagery that Sarah Gruen creates in depicting the 1930's Circus world is amazing. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to smile.,overall
Jacob is a fiesty 90 or 93 year old as he says. This book is written well, starts off grabbing the reader, and never lets him down.  One of those, \I want to read it more\ books. The authors research is extensive and from my experience accurate. From senior nursing facilities to the great depression she has it all down. A great read that you hope will never end. Better have a great book ready to go when  you finish this one.,overall
Being an avid reader with little time to do so, I do not waste my time on just any book.  This book is a true winner; one that I will think about for years to come.The author spent much time researching circus life in the 20's and 30's and it shows.  The book had such vivid characters and the story line was fast-paced and so, so interesting.  The blending of fact and fiction is expertly done!!!  Having never really been interested in circus life, I found things out that were surprising and shocking!  Life with the circus was a rough, tough, hard, shocking life that was full of strict rules and social status.  However, these rules changed on the whims of the owners/operators and changed many fates for the worse.  The original black and white photos included throughout the book add to the total top quality of this great read.The main character, Jacob, narrates his life story at the age of 90-something.  While the story-line jumps from present to past, it is easy to follow and never confusing.The characters are wonderful and you will find yourself so caught up in the plot of this book. I could not turn the pages fast enough. I guarantee you will laugh, cry, and be shocked when you are finished reading this great read.  It will leave you wanting for MORE.Do yourself a favor and get this book and just ENJOY!!!,overall
interesting and easy to read. In excellent shape. I am use to reading non fiction books. But found this novel to have a lot of truth in it.Always have been interested in the circus life.,overall
I was so taken by this story when I first started reading it that I told my Mom about it, suggesting that she would love it. I was almost finished with the book when my Mom passed away. When going through her things, I found a copy of \Water for Elephants\, and it really hit me hard emotionally, much like Jacob's feelings when his parents died (my Mom died from a neural hematoma after slipping on a step ladder). Now, almost five years later, I was able to bring myself to finish reading this wonderful tale, and I am so glad I did.,overall
Overall very Good book.  As a movie, I had no interest in the story. However, I decided to give it a shot only because it was an available book at the time I was browsing. Very intriguing! Enjoyed the book and am sure you will too.,overall
This book was great! Unable to put it down, very detailed. It made me feel like I was there!!! Can't wait to see the movie.,overall
I just finished reading this book and I can't wait to recommend it to others. I was certainly THE best book I have read in a long time. It was mesmerizing and had me hooked right from the beginning.  The book is well written and reflects careful research and attention to detail. I will be looking for more books from this fabulous author.,overall
...a young man ran away and joined the circus, where he found love, sex, death, redemption and family. A splendid story that I could not stop reading until the end, with a cast of characters that is beautifully realized--no shortcuts, no stock characters, everyone explored and explained and unique. Very highly recommended.,overall
I enjoyed this book from start to finish. My only criticism is regarding a little to much explicit sexual description and violent animal abuse. Otherwise, I found it very well written, and a fascinating tale.,overall
I really like it. I am going to watch the video if I can find it.  The historical parts  are fascinating.  I have been to some IN historical circus places.  Those times were tuff but very interesting.,overall
I enjoyed the book so much that I had to see the movie to see what they would do with the story.  I liked most of the characters.,overall
This was a very well written book.  I also appreciated the comments made by the author on her research and the way she brought the stories she uncovered into the book.,overall
This was a wonderful book...hardly took me anytime to read it. Held my attention & was fast moving & interesting. Would highly recommend to animal lovers for sure...but also to those who enjoy books bout people.,overall
An adventure - inside the circus but more importantly inside one man's experience of others.  Very deep.  Glad they made it a movie so more people can experience it, but it is always better to read the book.,overall
This book was so interesting to me and it moved me.  I liked how the author portrayed each and every character -- flaws and all.  I especially liked the main character and his thoughts on aging.  It evoked many emotions from me.,overall
This book was wonderful, such great incite into the circus world of the depression era. Loved the characters and the transition from the past to the present.  Recommend it highly.,overall
This is a wonderful story.  I first heard it on Chapter A Day and just finished reading it to fill in the parts I'd missed.  The extra bonus in reading the book is seeing all the fascinating historical pictures Gruen gathered from various circus museums.  I loved that some of the amazing things that Gruen discovered in her research about circus were woven into the story.  She began her research into the world of circus life by contacting Circus World Museum in Baraboo, WI which we have been to and love.  Gruen's book has added a whole new dimension to the world of the circus.,overall
Highly recommended.  Good authors are hard to find -- Sara Gruen is one of those.  The plot, the grammar, the characters, the research, -- all excellent.  I have given this book to friends as a gift -- my highest recommendation.,overall
I read The Glass Castle and didn't think I could ever find another book that would grab my attention like that one did.  WRONG!!  If you liked Glass Castle... your going to love this book.  Don't the title deter you.I totally enjoyed this book.  Enjoy,overall
This is an uncommon setting and an out-of-the-ordinary character makes this book a surprisingly wonderful read! I love this author's style.,overall
This is one of the most well written books I've ever read.  I'm not much on fiction, but this is an enthralling story.  I didn't think it would appeal to me much but a friends' endless raves convinced me to give it a try.  It's gritty, gutsy, appalling, delightful, sad, glorious, and many other adjectives.Movie supposed to be out this year also.  Can't wait!,overall
I enjoy reading about things in this timeframe.  The book was very good but I would be afraid to see the movie because I don't like to see bad things happen to animals.  Somehow reading about such things doesn't affect me as seeing it.  This book was well written and I would recommend it to my friends.  Loved the ending.,overall
After 132 previously written reviews I know there is not much new to say about this book. So, I will just say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Ms. Gruen states in the Author's note that she was going to write an entirely different book and instead wrote this one and I am so glad that she did. The research and old pictures make this a once upon a time story. The story is hypnotic and truly heartwarming from beginning to end. If looking for a great read, this is it.,overall
I read this book after I saw the movie to compare which can be a mistake but not in this case. Of course there were some differences but both the book and the movie were very enjoyable.,overall
\Water for Elephants\ is on the best sellers list! No wonder! It was a great book. I enjoyed each segment whether it was set at the nursing home or the circus. I thought the characters were well thought out and believable. We will review this book at our next book club meeting.,overall
Gruen got inside the circus. This story is told from an old man's point of view, but we see Jacob clearly as a young man too.If you like action with a little romance, this is a good read.,overall
Beautifully written! It told the story of the great depression, the hard life, the loneness! I believe the animal cruelty was needed to show the mind set of the time period. It was a very different time/life! Could you live then? Are you strong enough?! No we aren't the same class of people! Please read this story a wonderfully written book!!,overall
At first I was hesitant about reading this book. I figured that reading about a traveling circus really wouldn't appeal to me, and I didn't understand why it was continually being suggested to me on this website. Eventually, I gave in and bought it. I pushed it aside for months, never bothering to read it, still mostly uninterested. Finally, bored one day, I picked it up and started reading. Two pages in, I didn't want to put it down.The opening is clever, leading to a fantastic ending. The writing style is charming, falling in love with the main character is completely inevitable.This is definitely on my top-ten list of novels. It is so beautifully written, I highly recommend it to anyone. It has all the mystery, love, emotion, and intrigue a novel should.I only hope the rest of her books are as lovely.,overall
I saw the movie first and knew after that I had to read the book. One of my favourite in a long time.,overall
Not only was Sara Gruen able to get completely inside of Jacob Jankowski's head, she was able to grab hold of me and bring me along.  I lived this story alongside of Jacob, and loved every minute of it.  For days after finishing the book, I missed the characters profoundly.  In my mind, that's success.  It's been a good long while since I've read anything that touched me like this one.  Kudos, Sara Gruen!,overall
Very nice interesting book -- a nice change from romances or killer/thrillers!  Relaxing and enjoyable! I would definitely read this author again.,overall
Outstanding story--I was very sorry to have it end!  I kept thinking of the story for a couple days later.  I would recommend it highly!!!!!!!!!!,overall
I loved this book!  I don't generally give 5-star ratings, as I believe that most books could use some improving.  This book was wonderful.  It was engrossing and readable and the story was believable.  It was obvious that the author did a lot of research about train circuses as well as elephants.I would recommend this book to anyone who has a couple of hours to slip into another world and enjoy the characters created in this world.,overall
This is a lovely story.  Not something that I would normally pick to read but it had me hooked from the start.  I enjoyed it right through to the end.,overall
I was a bit apprehensive about reading this book, but found it surprisingly refreshing in its approaches (spoken from two time periods) and its treatment of life as part of a circus \family.\  While the senior perspective was somewhat depressing, it was quite vivid of how one can be forgotten when one has so much life left to live and so much to share.  I also liked reading the excitement of the junior perspective, his trials and tribulations.  I think that both could have easily been expanded and still kept the reader's interest - wanted to know more about each character who are one and the same!  Bravo!,overall
Could not put this book down, read from front to back and held on tight.  Without giving the good stuff away, you are there in the book at all times....amazing....wonderful.The twist on Jacob from the Bible (which you won't notice unless you read the Bible) is a grabber!We all will get old some day.....and if you are close, give this book to family members waiting to put you in a nursing home.  I think what got me the most was  \pay attention\.I don't even want to see the movie...this was good enough for me!,overall
Do you ever have a book \shoved down your throat (brain)\ by friends in bookclubs, to the point that you rebel and refuse to read this \wickedly popular book?\ Well, that's what had happened to me, regarding this gem. Five separate friends, in five separate bookclubs wouldn't stop yammering about this book and exclaiming, \Oh! If you read ANYTHING this year, you MUST READ THIS!!!!\So, fool me once, shame on you...fool me twice, shame on me! I've read highly recommended books and ended up HATING THEM! Too boring, too dark, too something or another, so I've learned to smile and nod and say, \Gee, thanks for that recommendation. I'll have to look into it,\ and of course, I don't.Well, thank goodness for a rainy-soaked Mother's Day weekend and the virtues of my Kindle app! I had just finished my last book, couldn't find anything of interest that I wanted to read, got an email from amazon about \Reduced Rate Kindle Books,\ and ~shrugged~ figuring that a $4 buck and change e-book wouldn't set my finances back, much. Once I started this novel, I couldn't put it down! I am now dining on \crow and humble pie\, and have acknowledged that in THIS incident, my 5 friends were correct...this is a MUST read book!The characters are charismatic, whether Good, Bad or Ugly. People evolve or de-volve throughout the story. The circus, that time frame, and the animals all turn real, inside your imagination. Bad things happen in this story, and good things, then bad and good again. The tension is riveting, and you decide that \just one more page, just one more hour\ is necessary to find out what happens...until you turn the last paper or e-page of this novel.All I can say is, \Continue to listen to your friends!\ Sometimes, they truly DO know that you'd \love this book!\,overall
Holy cow!  What a Book!  Here we have a novel written by a woman whose lead character is a young man, er... old 93 year-old man, er... an elephant named Rosie.  Never mind.  But she does it!  She pulls it off.  The story-telling is spellbinding.  You are right there in the blackness of night, wobbling precariously on the roof of a train crossing a trestle with a knife gritted in your teeth and murder in your heart.  You love Rosie the elephant. You ache with fear and infatuation for Marlene, trapped in the grasp of a lethal psychotic maniac.Sara Gruen is a literary gem to put us in the mind and depression times of the traveling Circus's, the smell of the animals, the freaks, and the language. How about fathoming the mind of a cranky, reminiscent 93 year old coot whose character and lovable humanity hold the whole thing together?So what's next?Pierce Scranton M.D.author, Death on the Learning Curve,overall
The startling life of a man left behind in a home stays with you. Each of us happily cheers for the hero as he drifts back to his circus days. You only hope your own life is as full where romance and engaging performers tug at your soul. A+.,overall
Jacob Jankowski, like many Americans, was having a hard time in the Great Depression.  After failing to complete veterinary school, he ends up working on a traveling circus, going to town after town with the big top acts, the freak shows, and the menagerie of exotic animals.  He quickly learns that there is a darker side to the circus behind the scenes that the happy, popcorn eating crown never sees.The set up workers are considered expendable and are kicked off the train if they stay on past their usefulness, and animals are often treated cruelly and ruthlessly.  Out of necessity, sometimes life was cruel during the Great Depression, but sleazy ringmaster Uncle Al and violent animal trainer August Rosenbluth choose to perpetrate this unnecessarily at the Benzini Brothers circus.  Jacob remains part of this world as he is tied by love and duty to the animals in his care, as well as his friends and the beautiful Marlena, wife of August.This was not always an easy book to read.  There are graphic scenes of animal cruelty that had me wincing, as well as heartbreaking scenes of human disappointments and pain.  Despite this, I recommend this novel wholeheartedly.  Sara Gruen describes the scene perfectly, from the Great Depression to the atmosphere of the circus, and there are some uplifting messages about the powers of kindness and love for the reader to take away as well.  I also recommend her previous two novels Riding Lessons and Flying Changes.,overall
This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It has an engaging premise, characters I came to care about and it is well written.Because the setting for the story is obviously a circus Ms. Gruen gives us a great deal of information about this business. Thankfully this adds to the story and doesn't bog it down. This story showed me that the circus is as much a lifestyle as it is a business.I would recommend this book to anyone and will probably read it again - and these are the highest compliments I can give to a book.,overall
The readers, both the old and the young Jacob, do a great job of bringing this novel to life!,overall
I probably would not have picked this book up on my own because I dont really care for circuses and the thought of clowns freak me out. This was a book club selection that someone else had picked, so I gave it a try. What I found was a story that hooked me.I was so terrified to read about any animal cruely, and to be truthful there is some of that in this book. However, I found myself not able to put it down.The story was more about someone who had chosen a path in life, and then when a devestating act occurs  changes that path to something totally differently.I think the whole lesson of the book is that life may be taking us one way, and then one little moment can change everything. That changed moment can even make us think that what we wanted was not what we really wanted after all.As for the animal cruelty, while I hate it, I had to say that it really did occur and probably still does occur in some circuses. Very hard for me to stomach, but at least the author put the truth in the book.I am not going to summarize the book. All I can really say is pick it up and give it a try. A definite entertainment. Also, for those not too crazy about clowns, well my doubts were not founded in that department. There is not really mention of them that I can recall.,overall
I did not see the movie, but would like to. This book held my interest from beginning to end. I would recommend this book for both men and women. I learned a lot about the circus world. Didn't think I wanted to, but found out differently.,overall
After reading the hysterical prologue (\A polar bear towered above it all, slashing blindly with skillet-sized paws. It made contact with a llama and knocked it flat - BOOM. The llama hit the ground, its neck and legs splayed like the five points of a star...\) it is no surprise that this book is a NYT best seller. What is surprising is that it's only Gruen's third book - with prose like this you would easily expect her to have a dozen or two novels under her belt by now. Couple that with Gruen's attention to detail, which is reflected in her extensive research of the subject. Bet the original publisher who turned this manuscript down for lack of interest is sorry he did so. (Ms. Gruen did herself a favor in finding a new publisher!)I left the book feeling like I was friends with the characters - the cantankerous, honest yet likeable Jacob, the beautiful Marlena, the humourous and captivating Rosie. Rosie easily stole the show - as the title suggests - and you felt a special relationship with her as you went through her trials and tribulations while part of the Benzini Brothers entourage. Her behavior is nothing short of stunning and miraculous towards the end. After the circus' collapse, how can Gruen deliver after such a memorable scene? You'll just have to find out. And you won't be disappointed.,overall
I love reading books which captivate me so much that I constantly think about them; the characters, the plot...what's going to happen. When I was a child, Enid Blyton's books did the same thing for me. Sara Gruen is the kind of author a lot of people (including me) should aspire to be like.  Although this is a ficticuous novel, some of the events are true...Ms. Gruen should be applauded  for doing such an excellent job weaving past events with fiction. Her writing style is superb. Most people will probably start reading the book and think they know the ending......you won't!  That's how brilliant this author is.I highly recommend this book...and, oh, in addition, I would LOVE to see the next traveling circus.  (Do they still exist?),overall
Water for Elephants is a quick read that carries you through many experiences and emotions.  I enjoyed most of the characters (human and animal).  It was thrilling, sad, sexy and hearbreaking at times, but in the end you won't regret reading it!  You'll get the added bonus of reading historical fiction too.  Very good read, highly recommended.,overall
I love this book.  I even bought it for a friend who never reads and she loves it too.  The movie however was not that good compared to the book.,overall
What a lovely story this was! I feel like it was witten for hollywood, I cant wait to see the movie. I loved the fact that the story was remembered by an old man. The author REALLY got what it feels like to be old and she makes you get it also. I felt like I was right in the story, I read through this wonderful book in a few days. My only complaint is that it wasnt a little bit longer. This is only about 300 pages but I felt it should have been more.,overall
Another book I just couldn't put down. I did have to put it down for a little while, when the animals were mistreated. I also didn't like the fact that the circus employees weren't paid. Overall, it was a great story and I hope to read more books by this author.,overall
I held off reading this book because everyone I knew who had read it or was reading it loved it but kept referring to it as \depressing\ or \violent\ or with other strong negative adjectives.  I wasn't in the mood for a \downer.\  Nothing else in my \recommended for you\ list appealed to me so I downloaded the free sample.  This book is everything everyone said it would be...violence, cruelty, betrayal, death but somehow the story grabs you and won't let go.  Told by a 90 or 93 year old vet from a circus, the story is as personal as a biography and engrossing as a news account of the circus in the 1930s.  I read it in 24 hours.  Buy, borrow it or download it...it will not disappoint!,overall
I loved everything about this book! Jacob, Marlene, Walter, Camel and of course dear dear Rosie. It is very well written.,overall
Every now and then I find a book that is so wonderful.  It's like finding the lone needle in a haystack.  This book is a treat.  Imagery is beautiful, characters are fabulous, and I loved that the animals had personalities (as they do in real life).  I recommend this for someone who loves to read for pleasure.  Can't believe I almost didn't read this because it was about a circus; that would have been my loss.,overall
And read this fabulous story.  I could not put it down.  The author's insight into all things human, notably aging, is phenomenal.  This book is top of the line in every respect.  Thank you Sara Gruen for all your inspired research and talent.,overall
Having read after watching the movie, it's hard not to imagine Reese Witherspoon and Robert Patinson as the lead characters.  The book is very engaging and a quick read.,overall
Reading the first line of this book caught me immediately. I have ADD with books sometimes, but this one, I didn't slip a word. The author makes you care about everyone, even the jerks.,overall
This was a refreshingly interesting read due to its uniqueness.  Much research was done to make it as realistic as possible and it shows through - you'd be missing out not to read this book!,overall
This book was recommended to me by a friend. I went out, bought it and finally read it. It was amazing book. The book kept me hooked to the last sentence.  It was well writtin and you get to feel sorry for the old man but he finds peace in the end.  This book does not disappoint.  It is a time peace but you will still love it.,overall
I love this book! It has such great detail and description I feel like I'm there! I would highly recommend it,overall
Water for Elephants is one of the best books I've read in a long time. This book was mentioned several times in the House at Riverton book club I participated in; and was a huge seller during the holidays on Amazon.  I figured even though it wasn't a book I would normally pick up and start reading, I would give it a try.I'm so glad I did!The story setting was depression era circus life...more than intriguing! Sara Gruen did an amazing job with her research and the detail she outlined in the book.  She was able to find a perfect balance of grisly and romantic.  Gruen used that same \memory sequence\ style of storytelling as The House at Riverton, Titanic, and Rebecca.  The flips from past to present were seamless.Gruen's depiction of the narrator as a 98 year old man was awesome.  She allowed the reader to understand the traumas of being \that old\ as well as remind us there's often a pretty amazing story to most of the older generation.Each character had a function in the story, including the nursing home staff.  There were no superficial characters and every single character helped you to understand \who\ the main character was.This was one of those fun reads that sucks you in and makes you wish the story could go on forever.  I ended the book feeling like I wanted to join a circus, wanted a pet elephant, and wanted to work in a nursing home.  All very strange, indeed!  Its not often a book I read can make me want to do anything remotely close to those things.,overall
A true grit romance with all the details of the hard life of \carnies\.  An amazing tale of one man's life, survival and eventually love.,overall
When I read the summary of this book, I wondered why it was so popular.  It didn't sound like anything I'd ever want to read, but when a fellow book obsessed friend of mine told me that I had to read it, and I had to read it immediately, I took her advice.  Boy am I glad I did!  This book is so well written, the characters are great, and the story is absorbing.  I live near a circus museum, and am now planning a trip to visit because of this book.  I highly recommend it to anyone that loves a good story!  I've also read Riding Lessons and Flying Changes and am eagerly awaiting her next novel!,overall
Original, tension-filled and slightly bizaare.  The right ingredients for me.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes to read something different for a change.  Good story.,overall
Sara Gruen creates a Depression-era tale of a traveling Circus and fills it with some of the most memorable characters in recent fiction as well as a compelling tale of love and loyalty.Jacob Jankowski is struck with tragedy when his parents are killed in a car accident just as he is about to finish up his Veterinary degree at Cornell.  Not knowing what to do with himself, he jumps aboard a random train and finds himself on one of the Benzini Brothers Circus cars.  He gets hired to be the circus vet and is tasked with keeping the menagerie of animals healthy.Things are not easy at Benzini and Jacob soon finds himself in the middle of the fiery relationship between the show's Ringmaster, August, and his wife, Marlena, the horse rider.  When a unique elephant named Rosie joins the circus Jacob forms a special bond as Rosie only responds to commands in his native Polish language.Gruen's use of language and flashing forward and back between young Jacob and the 93-year-old version of himself in the present are remarkable.  This is a novel the reader will long remember after turning the final page.,overall
I could not put it down buy how often do you need to here that to read a book. you will enjoy this . promise,overall
This well written story introduces the reader to the myriad of life that belongs to the Circus.  The author developsthe characters from the top brass to the lowest workers, who are sometimes thrown off the train while it is in transit.  Some of the animals are more important than the workers  The story is told in first person by a veterinary student who joins the circus after the tragic death of his parents  His young life in the circus is contrasted by chapters describing the latter part of his life in an assisted living facility where he is left only with his memories.

With a book like this...when i come on to review - i check the negative reviews first.  I could not believe there were ANY 1 star reviews; tho i did read them...and really found nothing i agreed with (obviously - i gave it 5 stars!).  But compare for yourself the amount of high reviews, compared to low reviews.I read many, many books - and have for over 35 years.  This is one of the best, in every way.  The writing style, the characters, the story, the way it develops - and i personally like the \back and forth\ way of telling it... the remembering.  I LOVED IT.  I would put it in my Top 20 - and like i said - i've read many.  The book is great... what more can i say?  Enjoy!,overall
What a awesome read.  I loved the characters.  I did not see the movie, so the ending was a bid of a shock to me in a good way.  This was on my summer reading list.  I couldn't put it down once I started.,overall
I'm a little late to the party on this book, but I just loved it. I had picked up Ape House, her second book, and got about halfway through before I gave up - it's really strange and awful. I wouldn't even have read this one unless it hadn't been our book club pick.Now I understand the hype. I love fiction where you learn something, and though this is no Grapes of Wrath, it's a great picture of Depression-era life, and the information on circuses was absolutely fascinating (if incredibly depressing). Put that together with a solid love story and I was sold.Chapters switching between times can be annoying, as you're essentially getting to know two different characters, even if it's the same person, but I felt it worked well here.Highly recommended.,overall
Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is one of my all-time favorite books! The story is told by an old man looking back on his life in the circus during the Great Depression. As a young man he joins the circus after his parents died in a car accident. There he discovers a whole new and strange world in the small traveling community. He learns the hard work involved in the back scenes of a circus, as well as the harsh and sometimes tragic lives of the workers. It isn't long before he falls in love with the beautiful Marlena, one of the star performers. Things are complicated though. She's already married to the controlling and cruel head animal trainer.Get ready to cheer for the hero, boo the villain and ooh and ahhh at the story that draws you into a bygone time and place. It's a memorable book that will stay in your heart a long, long time.,overall
I liked everything about this book, but I especially loved the contrast between Jacob as a young man and his life as a 90 (or 93) year old. It's one of those stories that older people tell that makes young people realize they need to sit down and talk with the elderly people they know, or this type of story is going to be gone forever. Jacob's story of the circus and falling in love were so moving, but when you see what happens to Jacob as an old man, it is bittersweet. I was expecting the end to be much more of a downer - I thought the ending was very uplifting.,overall
Great novel.  At first I was hesitant to read this despite the great reviews because I just couldnt understand how a novel about a circus could be any good, but boy was I wrong.  This novel has suspense and romance and you really understand and fall in love with the Jacob, the main character.  It is a must read.,overall
Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is a well told and well researched book about the early days of the American circus. The book is told both in the present and in 1931 by Jacob Jankowski. We start with him in an old folk's home, where he tells us he's either 90 or 93. He's past caring at this point about pretty much anything. Then one day he sees a bunch of the other patients gathered at one of the windows. He goes over to see what they are all looking at and finds that the circus is in town, and within throwing distance of his geriatric home.The appearance of the circus brings back memories of his first experience with the circus, which began just as he was finishing his veterinarian degree at Cornell University. He goes through a tragic time and leaves in the middle of his final exams, walking until his legs get tired. Where his legs led him was to the town's railroad tracks. He jumps on the next passing train, although it's late at night and he's not sure what type of train he's just hitched. In the morning he finds that it's a circus train and he's taken on as the circus veterinarian.The book then goes through his time on the circus, his interactions with the beautiful Marlena and her abusive husband, August. Not only does August treat Marlena badly, but he abuses the animals, especially Rosie, the Polish-speaking elephant taken on by Uncle Al, the circus ringleader.I know not all people are huge fans of circuses, but if you can stomach it I highly suggest you read this book. It's obvious from her writing that Gruen has a soft spot for the circus and this time period. She wrote about it in a lovely way, without being too easy on the circus operators. She showed the dark side of the circus (beating animals, low pay, difference between working men and performers, etc.) without overdoing it. I never felt like she was trying to harp on about animal abuse or any of the other terrible things that used to happen in circuses. And the archive photos from Ringling and other circuses made the book even that much more fun to read.,overall
This is a very well-written novel.  The characters are realistic and the story is interesting.,overall
Water for Elephants was beautifully researched and written. It's not only romantic, but the history and thrills make this book hard to put down. I loved how Jacob transformed from young to old; and of course the relationship with Rosie was amazing, it brought tears to my eyes a few times. The twist ending is one of the best I've read; I'm still in shock. Water for Elephants will forever be a favorite of mine. A definite must-read.,overall
What a wonderful book...at frst I wasn't sure I would like it but it just kept getting better and better.  If you're looking for a book that will lock you in....this is it !,overall
I wasn't so sure I'd like this book by it's title, but I loved it!  It's a great read with a wonderful story line and characters with whom the reader becomes friends.  I read it in one sitting -- couldn't put it down.,overall
I could not stop reading. As my first  KF download I can't wait to read more stories like this. I was dreaming about the book last night ... I could write the sequel.,overall
Water for Elephants is told by and about Jacob Jankowski, a cranky but likable 90 year old (or perhaps 93) man who resides in an assisted living center.  The story maintains its momentum by alternating between the past and the present as Jacob recalls the circumstances under which he found himself traveling with the Benzini Brothers Circus.Through Jacob, the author Sara Gruen, presents us with a fascinating history of the American circus as well as a painful look at the time known as \The Great Depression\. Gruens storytelling technique is enhanced by the period circus photos (circa 1920-30) that appear at the beginning of each chapter.The eccentricities of the characters as well as the alarming treatment of both animals and performers propels the story and mezmerizes the reader.  The complicated interpersonal relationships of the circus \family\ is deftly interwoven with that of the rest home \family\.I was truly seduced by this book.  Reading it was an unexpected and astonishing adventure that continued to resonate long after I had read the last page and closed the book.,overall
The story moves cleverly between the world of 90, or possibly, 93 year old, Jacob, in a nursing home, as he tells the story of his life, the Depression era and the circus world.He was twenty-three and almost ready to take his final exam, when he receives word that both of his parents were in a car accident and did not survive. There was no money as he sat to take his final exam to become a veterinarian.  Feeling desperate Jacob jumps on a moving train instead.  Having no idea he has jumped on a circus train, he decides he has nothing left and starts working with the circus. He meets a beautiful woman, Marlena, but finds out quickly she is married to a mad-man. However, she returns the attraction and a great love story begins.Water for Elephants is a compelling story that tells us all about growing old, corrupt management, animal cruelty, wonderful animals, kindness and loyalty between people and between people and animals in a world where indifference and cruelty are common.The author's obvious extensive research of history and circus life added so much interest to the background of a wonderful meaningful, love story.This is such a wonderful read and well worth your time!,overall
I bought this book on a whim at a bookstore at an airport while waiting for my flight.  I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.  I am generally not a fiction reader, but this book was so \real\ that I couldn't put it down.  The author tells the story from the viewpoint of a 90-something year old man from start to finish.  A young 20-something almost done with veterinary school's world comes crashing down when his parents are involved in a freak accident that causes their death.  Not knowing what to do with his life, Jacob signs on to work for a traveling circus.  Not only does this book paint an accurate picture of its protagonist, but it paints an accurate historic picture of life with animals, traveling with a circus, and the time period in which the book is set.I recommend this book to anyone.  It is an easy and quick read that will impress you start to finish.,overall
I could not put this book down!!!  Loved it.  Wonderful story, written beautifully, highly recommended.  I don't usually tell my husband about the stories I read, but I kept telling him about this one.I don't understand some of the negative reviews I've read about this book.I truly enjoyed it and wish there were more like it.,overall
Could not put this book down. Eye opening and very well written. A must read for all book lovers.,overall
This review refers to the audio CD.  I have listened to perhaps 50 audio CDs and this voice is the best!  Some audio CDs I cannot get through because I find the reader's voice too irritating.  This speaker is clear, easy to listen to, and does an outstanding job mimicing the characters.  The story itself is one of the best I have heard or read in a long while.,overall
I've rediscovered my love of reading and this book helped in this effort.  It's one of the best books I've ever read.  It was very creative, well-written, and funny and serious at all the right times.  The characters were vivid and believable and I could envision the traveled landscape.  I highly recommend this one!,overall
I adored Water For Elephants when I read it the first time, but it was on my second reading that I realized the extreme skill Gruen exhibits on every page and in every scene. Her prose is crisp and exacting, and her characters are so vivid, they leap to life in this story that grabs hold of you and  doesn't let go. I was literally transported to another place in time. I can't recommend Water For Elephants highly enough. This book deserves all the praise it's received and then some. What a beautiful novel--a treasure for all who curl up with this gem!,overall
Secrets that we keep. Don't all of us have them? And will we ever tell? This story, told by the aged narrator skips back and forth in time, but never loses the reader. We get a fabulous behind the scenes look at the old days of the circus world woven in with Jacobs secret. This one is definitely a keeper!!,overall
I was hesitant to read is book, because the storyline, setting, and time-period we're not what I usually read. I was surprised at how much I got into this book and could barely set it down. You really MUST read this fantastic book, you will not be disappointed!,overall
This is up on my top ten list of books. I loved this book when I started it I couldn't put it down. Even my daughter who is not a reader per say read this book in one day. This is one I plan on rereading this book.,overall
I was hooked from the beginning and looked forward to coming back to the story each time I had to turn off my Kindle.  Coming of age in a circus might seem cliche yet the insiders view of the social dynamics that existed within a circus really put context around the whole \running away to join the circus\ thing; although, in this case, it might be more apt to describe this as \stumbling into the circus\.  Regardless, while I felt the end of the circus component of the story was somewhat predictable, it didn't spoil the story for me.  A truly remarkable story that I will enjoy again and again.,overall
Loved this book - hard time to put it down. Gives alot more insight than the movie, although the movie was very well done.,overall
This is an excellent, well writen book that takes the reader to a world that is seldom encoutered by the average person. It is a well researched account of the USA circus of 1929, including the good and bad. It was a glamarous facade hiding unimagined cruelty to animals and people.,overall
I couldn't put this book down.  The characters are well drawn and the details of circus life are fascinating.  I got pulled in and hated for it to end.,overall
Sensitive and moving story with some real insight into the aging mind as well as historical view of the old circus. A book both to entertain and learn from. One of those books you are sorry when it is over,overall
I missed the movie, so I bought the book.  I read reviews, both movies and books and am anxious to read this book.,overall
I like this book it is well written, has an input to  what it was the life in a cirque decades ago. Its the story of a young man with a sorry story that turns for the right way and falls in love. Deep characters and a well developed story.,overall
I have had Water for Elephants on my wish list for quite some time now...when the movie came out I thought I better read it before someone gave the ending away. As soon as I started reading the first line I couldn't stop. I caught myself hiding my kindle under my desk so I could read the next few lines and holding my breath while doing so. This book is so brilliantly written I don't even know how to review it. Sarah G. is so passionate about the animals and the characters in this book that you will find your heart breaks at certain turns and you cheer out loud for the loveable Jacob. I was so incredibly sad when it ended that I immediately ordered another book from Sarah G....The Ape House and I have to say I'm equally enthralled by it.,overall
Truth be told, I was not interested in reading Water for Elephants. The subject matter, a memoir of a 93 year old former circus veterinarian, was not interesting to me. But this book got such rave reviews on Amazon that I decided to pick it up. And am I glad I did! The book grabbed me from the first chapter. The author gives life to some very interesting characters and the reader gets a true behind the scenes look at the citizens who made up a circus during the depression. The narrator of the story is Jacob, who runs away to join the circus after his charmed life takes a tragic turn. He gets a real life education. So did I while reading this book. I shed a few tears too. I could not put it down, and didn't want it to end. I will highly recommend this book, and I'm so glad I read it!,overall
You will be glad you read this book before the movie, even if the movie is true to it in detail.  Few movies do their masterpiece books justice, and this book is a masterpiece.,overall
I was at a bookstore a couple of years ago holding \Water for Elephants\ when someone came and told me that this book was depressing. Since I never liked circus and I was not in the mood to read about circus in the first place, I took that comment as a cue to not read this book.Since then, the number of 5 stars reviews has been growing and growing...I spotted \Water for Elephants\ recently at the public library and decided to give it a shot. That woman that told me a couple of years ago that this book is depressing couldn't be more wrong. And this is not a book about circus either. Sure enough, the circus is on the background but this is basically a love story during the Great Depression/prohibition, a time in our history that we should never forget.It is very well written, with the right balance between characters development and action. It is, above all, good entertainment made to the contemporary readers.,overall
Was an awsome book , best I've read would suggest it to all my friends, Diffrent than I have read but very ,very good,overall
What a fantastic read. I had seen the movie and I wanted to read the book as well. I am so glad I did. Though the movie followed it very well, the book gives you more in-depth information that leads you along, their thoughts and some of the behind the scene activity that the movie could not show.Sara Gruen is a marvelous writer and so descriptive with her writing. You could almost smell the sweat of the men, the hay, the booze. You could hear the music and feel the drums pounding as the animals entered the Big Top.The story was so well told that it made you feel what Jacob felt both as a young man and as a 93-year-old man.I highly recommend it to anyone!,overall
We meet Jacob in a nursing home with the story weaving his current existence and tribulations with his past life as the 'vet' of the Benzoni Brothers Circus at the time of Prohibition ; his love for and ultimate marriage to Mailena and finally the story finishes with a most unexpected chain of events.,overall
This is the absolute best book I've read in a long time. I only wish it had been 1000 pages longer so I could have kept reading it for a longer time.  The characters were well developed and the story was fantastic.  Great escape.,overall
I don't normally read books based in this era, but I found it to be very interesting and it was hard to put down.  This was my first E-book downloaded onto my Kindle and it was great!  I especially liked the pictures of the circus that Sara Gruen included in her book.  It was very easy to picture the characters while reading.  Well done!  Now I may rent the movie to get another perspective.,overall
The book was better than the movie.  Characters seemed real.  Liked the detail about the animals and life on the rails.,overall
I loved this book. Cleverly written after detailed research by the author. Scholarly, well-woven storylines gives a wonderful look at those magical olden days of the dark side of the depression and the people who attempted to escape into the private world of the traveling circus.,overall
Wonderful fast paced read. Not once was I bored with this story! I laughed, cried, and was angrered in some parts, but this is what the best books do. This will start filming May 22nd starring Robert Pattinson, Reese Witherspoon, and Christoph Waltz (Inglorius Basterds). Read this book!,overall
I never wanted this book to end.  It was so interesting to read about living with a circus. One never knows what goes on behind the curtain and this story reveals the characters and their personal lives during the era of the 30's.  I want to go hug an elephant after reading about Rosie.  This book is a real page turner.  It would make a great movie.,overall
All children with old parents should read this book.Could not put it down. Would like to read more  books by this author.,overall
I enjoyed this book from start to finish.I'm not sure what it was exactly but it very much reminded me of Life of Pi which I also enjoyed.Jacob appealed to me as a character and I became genuinely interested in the fates of both rosy and the circus people.I preferred the chapters relating to Jacob's memory over those where he was an old man but this doesn't take away from the overall quality of the book. Although it is a fiction story I like that it was grounded with research and a combination of true stories which made the book feel more real.After reading the book I also watched the movie but as many people always say when they make a book into a movie, it wassnt half as good.,overall
We choose Water for Elephants for out bookclub by recommendation from one of our member's husband.  He is not a fan of reading and said he could not put the book down.  I must say he gave us an excellent book to read, for I could not put it down either.Going back and forth from present to past was seemless and spellbinding.  A great read for a book club or for just one's general enjoyment.,overall
As an animal-lover and not a fan of the circus, I felt a little wary of the setting and subject matter when beginning to listen to the unabridged audio version of WATER FOR ELEPHANTS. But soon I was totally hooked by the two narrators, young and old voices of Jacob, and by Gruen's evocative language and masterful storytelling. Like another reader/reviewer, I was reminded of family stories about the Depression--and of all we can go through and live through.,overall
I read the entire book while in the air on a round-trip cross country flight. It is a real page turner! The action was so captivating that it was hard for me to hear the flight attendant ask if I wanted anything to drink. The violence was difficult for me but I managed to skip over most of it. I loved the many good and happy surprises in the end.,overall
This is a book that you can't put down. The characters are great, and the plot is interesting. I loved it!,overall
A wonderful adventure, colorful descriptions of life in a Depression-era traveling circus, and characters that will touch your heart. What more could you ask for ?!,overall
I read the book at a friends home and decided I needed it for my own bookshelf. This book is about growing old and how the memories do not.,overall
I enjoyed reading Water for Elephants with it's many mini stories throughout. The characters were believable - Jake as the 91 (or 93) year old and his remembering of his life as a 23 year old. Anyone who has been to the yesteryear circus will recognize the descriptions of the circus coming to town and the excitement of the residents. There are funny incidents and sad ones that make up this book and the usual good and bad characters we all encounter. I admired the 91 year old Jake for his spunk when he took charge of his life as I admired the 23 year old Jake when he did the right thing for the animals of the circus. A great story that is heartwarming too.,overall
Much better than the movie. A short read and, if you're an animal lover, you will never want to see a circus again.,overall
I loved this book! Honestly the only reason I picked it up was because of the movie with Robert Pattinson (yes, I know...I rarely justify the reading of a book with an actor).  I really enjoyed the time setting for this book and the behind the scenes look at the life of a circus worker back then.  I also liked how the entire book wasn't just a love story and how nicely it was framed within the overall novel.  This is definitely a book that I would recommend and read again! And just as a side note, the move was awesome as well!,overall
I just simply loved this book! The unfavorable comments posted here did not impress me in the least, as I thoroughly enjoyed it. Does every writer have to  conform to the same old-same old standards? The atmosphere of the circus came through as though you were there! I will be reading her other books.,overall
I got this book because I absolutely adore the movie, but I think the book was just slightly better. The movie is still worth watching but the book seems sow ell put together. It has a wonderful amount of information that's accurate and the book is entertaining us more romantic readers. Fortunately there is so much more in-between, it's also beautifully written.The novel is based around Jacob our narrator of the past and the present. One moment he is a cranky old man who's not sure of the year, the next he's a veterinarian for the Benzini Brothers circus.  Where he is falling in love with his wife and taking risks to get to her and protect her before she is even his. Then he old alone and in a nursing home.  It seems Mr. Jankowski's life will forever be with the circus.At times the book was a bit tedious, over describing the circus scene and it's acts or just bombarding us with useless information.I loved the flawless flow from past to present with our narrator; every time it feels like we're jolted from a nap the same way Jacob is when we're back in his present.,overall
Gruen pens an all-encompassing story of intrigue, heartbreak, and hope with \Water for Elephants.\ It's 1931 and Jacob Jankowski is preparing to take his final exams in veterinary science when he receives the shock of his life - his parents were killed in a traffic accident. With no home to go to, he travels the rails until he hops onto a circus train.Camel Joe takes Jacob under his wing and ensures the young man gets a job. Jacob soon becomes the vet for the animals, but it's his interactions with August, Uncle Al, and Marlena that challenge his convictions. When Rose the elephant joins the circus, Jacob is put to the test. Will he follow his heart and stand up for his beliefs or walk away?Gruen's writing is easy to read. She's done her research and it shows. I especially liked how she used pictures to frame each chapter. The storyline is interesting. Jacob is coming-of-age and has to make decisions that aren't easy. The story alternates between old Jacob and young Jacob, and while not linear, Gruen pulls on the reader's heartstrings with the challenges old Jacob faces.  When a modern circus comes to the assisted living facility, old Jacob feels the tug of circus life, bringing the story full circle.For me, the best part was going on the emotional journey with the characters. They are very real with strengths and weaknesses that touch the reader's emotional core. The supporting cast is just as endearing.The book's plot is original and interesting. The setting is American circus life in 1931 and Gruen does a wonderful job making the reader believe the authenticity of the setting.The novel is mainstream fiction and while I was a bit hesitant to initially read a story about a circus, Gruen quickly sold me on the novel. I couldn't put the book down. \Water for Elephants\ will resonate with readers long after they've finished it. I highly recommend this book.,overall
Fantastic book! I would recommend it to anyone! I love all the detail the author puts into each character. It's a great love story as well.,overall
Wonderful book. Very sensual at places and in others action-packed. It was nice how the author gave the differing viewpoints. Great depression-era book. I highly recommend it.,overall
I took this book with me on a recent trip to South Africa and was delighted to have something to read that was so engaging that the time passed quickly. The story grabbed me from page one. It's an unusual story, beautifully written and with well-drawn characters. Although going back and forth between the past and present day was a little disorienting, I enjoyed getting to know Jacob as a 20-something and as a 90 (or 93) year old man.I really liked the device of using the prologue later in the story. And I loved the ending - it was perfect for the story, even though it's implausible and unbelievable. Sometimes that just doesn't matter. Sometimes it works anyway. Everything about this book worked for me.,overall
Water for Elephants is an amazing book.  The author took my mind into places I just did not want to go, into what it means to be a person at the end of life, still coherent but old and sick and living in a nursing home.At the end of your life, is that all that's left to hope for, that you end up in a nursing home with kids younger than your grandchildren bossing you around and moving you back to your room against your wishes after an argument with another nursing home resident?  Is this what the end of life means, an adult becomes a dependent child who must be bossed around by others, even if that person's mind and intellect are still intact?  Wow.  Of course I know these things happen, but never in fiction have I seen the final years of a person's life etched to the pages in such an emotional and moving way.,overall
This book was better than I expected.  The ending was happy but not cliche; my favorite kind! An easy, quick, entertaining summer read!!,overall
Absolutely loved the book (audiobook actually).  And I have more than a 6th grade education.  Go figure.Not having ever been in a 1930's circus (especially since I wasn't born until 1953), I can't say whether or not the characters were true to life.  I do know and have read extensively about cruelty to animals and am not surprised this sort of thing could happen in a 1930's circus.  It was a believable story to me and loved the ending.I listened to the book on audiotape on my morning walks and I intend to buy a hard cover copy of the book because it is one I will reread again and want to keep in my library.,overall
Neat way to get a glimpse into circus train life, the depression era, and life in an assisted living home.  This story was so well done weaving in and out of the past, and the characters were just wonderful.  I can't think of a thing I didn't like about this book!,overall
This book keeps you on your toes!  Sometimes can get confusing because you do not know if the character is in a dream or living in real life.  But all in all an easy book to read, and one that will keep you wanting to read on!,overall
\Carried water for elephants indeed. Do you have any idea how much water an elephant drinks?\ These words of Jacob Jankowski open this well-researched, fascinating novel about circus life. This story is told by ninety-something Jacob as he vacillates between the present and the past, reflecting upon an incredible life that was not always easy, but was satisfying.Jacob finds himself in a nursing home, his mind still active and questioning the meaning of his existence. Reminiscing about his life, he searches for meaning in the bland nursing home food and the fellow nursing home occupants, most of whom have surrendered their logical minds. As he remembers his life following the death of his parents when he was in his early twenties, he marvels at how every event led to the life he had.Well-researched and accurate, many incredible facts of circus life are divulged in this story. To add to this realism, there are actual photographs from circus archives. This is one unforgettable book!,overall
I listened to this while driving to and from school and I thought it was very interesting and entertaining. I liked hearing about all the different animals and their personalities. The old mans voice for the audio version is not very pleasant, at first you can hardly understand him.,overall
I've actually purchased this book for my Kindle a year and a half ago but didn't read it until this past week. I usually enjoy reading a good mystery or suspense which is why I had hesitated so long. What a mistake that was because this is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. I so enjoyed this book and felt all the emotions throughout it that I am sure the author tried to achieve. I learned a lot about the train circus from many years ago and what were some of the things that had gone on.I completely related to Jacob, the main character because I remember hearing stories from my parents regarding memories of their youth but now that I am in my mid sixties I too tend to think back of what was. There is somewhat of a sadness there of what was, good or bad and this is definitely what I can relate to. For me those memories that Jacob would tell us about and then bring us back into the present are profound. It is something I think we can all relate to especially when one ages.I love animals and hearing about the animals in the circus atmosphere way back then gave me both pleasure and dismay. My heart went out to Rosie the elephant.If I were to recommend one book this year to my friends and relatives to read, it would definitely be Water for Elephants.,overall
If you love the circus and love a great, star-crossed love story, this is the book for you. The author takes us back to the days when the circus arrived by train. She pulls no punches conveying both the magic and the horror of that world. Better than the movie and highly recommended.\,overall
After reading the novel, I saw the movie and without reading the book first, there were several scenes that I would not have understood.,overall
Jacob is a student at Cornell University studying to become a veterinarian to join his father in his practice.  When his parents are killed in a car accident Jacob returns home to learn that they had nothing left.  They were in deep debt and had mortgaged everything to keep their son in school.  Jacob  falls apart and leaves school.  He jumps on a train only to find out that it is a circus train.  he is hired first doing odd jobs and finally as their veterinarian. A major catastrophe at the circus shuts the circus down.  All of this action takes place in the prologue.In the first chapter we realize Jacob is in a nursing home.  He is seated at dinner with a newcomer to the home.  When conversation turns to the circus that will be visiting their town, his table partner mentions to the ladies at the next table that he used to work for the circus carrying water.  Jacob calls him a liar and is removed from the table and taken back to his room.  This is the beginning of our introduction to Jacob's memories of circus life.  This was a great book.,overall
An easy read and wonderfully descriptive.  One seems compelled to continuing reading this story, hard to put the book down once starting.,overall
What a wonderful and delightful book! This is a look thru the eyes of a 93-year young man of his experiences with the circus mixed with today.  What an experience he had in years gone  by; what we do to our elders now because we are too busy with our own  daily lives. This has an absolutely magnificent ending...something quite unexpected and heartwarming. I hope there is a circus in town when I get to Jacob's age and my family is busy with their life. I think I would make a great ticket taker.,overall
Written in the first person perspective, this story explains the life of an circus worker back in the old days, before any regulations were ever thought of.Rough and rugged lives wherein the guy with all the power hasn't much thought or care to the value of life - be it animal or human - but Karma wins in the end!Well written, kept my attention enough to loose sleep so I could keep reading it.As always, the book is better than the movie.  Read the book first and you will most likely understand the movie better.,overall
This book was hard to put down.  This powerful story brought the pain of well developed characters to life.  Sometimes I was afraid to read on knowing what I would read would be tragic but this story was told with such beauty I had to read on.  The story is told as a life history of a gentleman living in a nursing home and the description of his days being cared for in the home are so real.  The story of the circus performers, manager and all the tragedy was gripping.  I just had to keep reading - then the ending was a complete shock.  This was one of the best books I have read recently, but I can't think of seeing the movie.  I want to remember this story as I envisioned the settings and characters while reading.  It was a great book.,overall
This book is great start to finish. I didn't want it to end. I will miss these characters. The writer does such a wonderful job of painting such a poignant setting. Loved every second of it.,overall
This book was so interesting! I didn't know what to expect, but I was so impressed. It was like joining a community that is nothing like my real life and seeing the good and the bad of it. I was so interested throughout the entire book, and I particularly liked the photos from circuses in the past.,overall
i loved it.  could not put t down. i defy you to ead two chapters and not HAVE to finish.,overall
I loved this novel.  I am disappointed in the reviews that say the characters are too far fetched and the romance was unrealistic.  Its a fictional novel that explores a vet-school drop out, Jacob, who joins a circus by chance and falls in love.  The story he tells about life in the circus was thrilling and had me wanting to read more.When the chapters skip back to elderly Jacob, we see how he has gone through a lot in his early lives.  I love that he lives at an assisted living and tells his view of his life.The ending made me so happy and I couldn't stop smiling.  WELL worth it.  I might skip the movie because I am fearful that it will not give me what the book did!,overall
Every emotion is conjured up in this book-- love, humor, horror, disgust, relief, etc. I loved the historical aspect and the gritty, eye-opening of that era and lifestyle.,overall
This is such an amazing book! Didn't really know what it was about before I started it but it turned out to be a really great book.,overall
So beautifully written. It draws you in so quick. Beautiful story. Can't wait to watch the movie now. Love it,overall
To me, the mark of a good book is when you don't want to see it end. And when it does end, you can't stop thinking about it. That's how this book was to me. The characters were so richly drawn that I actually felt like they could be real people. When some of the injustices happened I had to remind myself that this was fiction. Sara Gruen writes this amazing story against a backdrop of the Great Depression and that adds so much to the story. I can't say too much about it without giving away important plot points, but I did not see the big twist coming. I'm surprised I didn't, as all the signs were there, but I was just so engrossed in the story that I didn't put them together. This is a book I will read again and again.,overall
I am in love with this book.  I could not put it down.  I love that the author switches back and forth between the young Jacob and the older Jacob.  At the beginning the two versions of Jacob seem so drastically different in how they view life, but once you near the end you really understand the character and what his life was like.  I truly enjoyed this not so typical love story.,overall
I was a bit skeptical about this book before I actually sat down and started reading it.  Immediately, I was drawn to the story and I couldn't put it down.  Marvelous tale of love, hate, betrayal and triumph during the great depression.  An excellent look into circus life, and the story wrapped up beautifully.  Highly recommended!,overall
This book was in my recommendation queue for weeks and I continuously passed it over for other books. I guess I was not totally wild to read about a circus during the great depression, but I finally caved in. I am so glad that I decided to read this book! I wouldn't go as far to say that it's the best book ever, but I enjoyed reading it immensely. The story was so unique from any other story that I have read; it was utterly captivating.This is obviously a story about a circus in the midst of the depression. Really, this book has multiple stories running at the same time and each one is fabulously crafted. From Jacob's story, a young man finding himself, the amazing animals and the absolute and total love and loyalty animals, especially Rosie the elephant ... WARNING, there are sections in this book that were very difficult for me to read, and will be for any animal lover. I have a VERY difficult time reading about animal cruelty, and Gruen spared little in her descriptions of how some of these animals were treated... the crazy Uncle Al, the even crazier August, and the enchanting Marlena, a young woman finding independence, all written to perfection.I was worried about how the ending would come to be, as I was so involved with each character. I was afraid that Gruen would just stop, but she tied up everything so neatly and painlessly. It was so beautifully done from start to finish. I strongly recommend reading this book.,overall
A wonderful romp back in time to the golden age of the Circus!The narration is non-linear and chock full of twists and surprises of a circus life not for the weak!The transitions back and forth in time enhanced the story by letting the whole picture emerge at a slower pace.As the story opens, Jacob is trapped in aging body, though his mind, at times a bit confused, is mostly quite perceptive and quick witted. The frustration with this battle between body and mind is poignantly revealed as we watch him testing the limits of his mobility and self-perseverance. Most of the time his `cantankerous' behavior is met with unsympathetic results.It's easy to understand how eating a steady diet of tediously bland and mushy foods when one has the teeth to chew on a cob of corn or a piece of meat could make one somewhat cranky!Had he been in his own home or cared for by relatives, the result probably would have been different....he'd have gotten a `real' dinner instead of visit by the Home's Psychiatrist with a diagnosis of geriatric depression followed by an unwanted dosing of Elavil.By alternating back in forth in time, I was able to be more empathetic with the 90 (or 93) year old Jacob. Seeing his youthful tragedies and how this angst over the sudden loss of his parents forces his life in a totally new and unexpected course is pivotal.He flees to survive.... and survive he does.... in a very gritty and cut-throat environment.There is no \safety net\ under this circus act and it's every man for himself. Given the time (depression-era) and situation, the harshness of this existence becomes quite credible.I think that this tough past, in part, helps the reader to understand why he's not very comfortable being coddled and restricted within the sanitary and ordered life of the Nursing Facility.He is left unchallenged and bored without much support from his dutiful, albeit rather distant children and grandchildren. He misses the unpredictability and excitement of his former Circus Life and of course the love of his life, Marlena.The different voices helped to move the story along and not keep the reader too long in any one place, while allowing the story to unfold with some genuine surprises.Highly recommended!,overall
This book was very entertaining - wish it was longer though.  I thought it was well-written, no complaints at all from me.  I would love to read more from this author.,overall
Water For Elephants grabbed me from the beginning and kept me captivated through its entirety.  I had a difficult time putting it down.  It was well-written, entertaining, and made me laugh and cry.  I highly recommend it.,overall
This is one of those fine books that you never want to end.  I can't complain about how it ended, however.  I just wasn't ready to leave the characters and story behind.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves reading.  Let's hope Ms Gruen writes another one like this.,overall
The story generated lots of good discussion.  The juxtiposition of the main character in youth and old age benefited both story lines, neither of which would have been as compelling without the other.,overall
WOW. Put this book on your MUST READ list. I bought this book because I was told my father-in-law, who recently passed away, had run away as a 13 yo child to join the circus in Europe.  He would have loved this book - he was exactly like the old, cantankerous Joseph, and probably the young one too. (Sara - did you know him?)From the moment I started it, I read straight through until I was done. I cannot remember the last time I did that.  It was just an awesome description of circus life AND the life of an old man.  It was two intertwined stories that made for a fabulous book.  Enjoy.,overall
'Water For Elephants' is one of those books that is so good it's hard to write down how deep your feelings for it are.  Jacob Jankowski is now ninety three years old and in an \assisted living\ facility, when the circus comes to town.  This brings back startling memories of his early life, when his world fell apart and he found himself on a circus train heading into his future.On the brink of passing his final exams for veterinary school, Jacob is informed that his parents have just died in an automobile accident.  Adding insult to injury, their house and practice were mortgaged to pay for his school and there's nothing left for Jacob.  He walks out of his final exam and keeps walking, until finding himself beside a railroad track.  Jumping the next train, he later realizes it's a circus train.  An old man named Camel helps him out, and gets him hired on with the show as the veterinarian.Jacob winds out bunking with a recalcitrant dwarf named Kinko and working for a man named August who's married to Marlena, a horse performer and a beautiful woman.  Marlena is off-limits, but Jacob can't help but admire her from afar.A twist of fate bring Rosie to the scene, an elephant abandoned by another defunct circus.  It seems Rosie is useless as a performer, and left under August's brutal treatments, until Jacob discovers that Rosie responds to the Polish language rather than English.  Once the language barrier is broken, Rosie becomes a star.  I could keep prattling on but I don't want to ruin the book.'Water For Elephants' is a beautifully written tale.  Switching back and forth between Jacob's current situation in his nursing home and his memories of the past, there's never a slow moment in Gruen's perfect prose.  The story is rich and well researched, the characters practically sparkle with life, and I could smell the animals and feel the train lurching beneath my feet.This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I suppose it helps that I love circus books and freak show books, but 'Water For Elephants' is more a book on humanity, and what sometimes lurks beneath the smiles and happy faces of troubled minds.  It's about greed and cliques, its about the depression era job desperation, its about abuse, and most of all its about the human heart.  Don't miss out on this 10 star tale.  Enjoy!,overall
Gruen has all the elements for a terrific novel - the circus, the Depression, a love triangle, a bitter old widower reflecting on his life ... but ultimately this is nothing more than a mediocre summer distraction for those of us who really don't like to read.I wouldn't write a review if not for the fact I was so let down by its strong premise. Other than the fact this quickly becomes a cheesy romance after promising so much more, I couldn't get passed thinking that one of the main characters, August, was trying to be Nathan from Sophie's Choice.Another problem was Jacob, the novel's main character and narrator. The problem I have is that despite the name - Jacob - and despite the fact he's in love with a beautiful woman, and despite the fact that - I don't know - he urinates standing up, the main character really is a woman who the writer calls a man. This is a problem I have with a lot of male writers when they write women (Wally Lamb is a rare exception). Jacob's behavior, thoughts, actions, words, everything, are those of a female character. So when Jacob and Marlena finally get together, well...If you're sitting by the pool or at the beach and there's nothing else to do or read, go ahead and read this one. It's not a terrible novel, just a disappointing one.,overall
This book was part of my wife's book club. The club loved it. So, I finally picked it up and started reading it. As a quick note subject matter for a book does not matter to me. I care about good stories with great characters and this book has it from cover-to-cover.Logically, I can't think why I would want to read a story set in the 1930s about the circus, but there I was reading it night after night. It's a fascinating story with superb description that is slippery-easy to read.I don't know what your hesitation is...read this book. There are tens of thousands of worse ones out there.,overall
Historical Fiction at its finest.  Don't miss this one.  A well developed story with wonderful characters.,overall
I'm not an advocate of circuses, what with the animal neglect, so for Rosie to get the last laugh made me happy. The characters really jump off the page and you can really see what a hard life it must have been on the tracks.,overall
We listened to this on a road trip out west and I loved it! The story itself was a great leave from my everyday, but the voices were fantastic! I loved hearing cantankerous 90 (or 93..) year old Jakob tell his tale. If you enjoyed reading this book, I'm sure you will love it more hearing the tale from the two Jakobs. If you haven't read the book, there is a good chance you will be drawn in by the storytellers and end up loving it. We sat in the car after we arrived home for the last 10 minutes of the book we were so enthralled.Get this and listen to it!,overall
Excellent book.  Have recommended to so many people. Couldn't put it down!! Stayed up way too many late nights wanting to read more.,overall
... and man, I wish I had read it when people first recommended it! This is the most compassionate, thrilling, historically detailed fiction ride I have ever been on. You MUST read this book; I was covered with goosebumps MANY times while reading it, and especially at the end.,overall
Gruen has woven meticulously detailed, fascinating fact into well-crafted fiction- this is a very enjoyable book! I never cared one whit for circuses before reading it, but now I think I have to go to a circus museum...,overall
This is one of the best books I've read this year.  A very engaging story.  You won't want to put it down.  It is a very quick, but highly enjoyable read.,overall
I loved this book.  It was breath-taking alive - as if I could smell it, taste it and feel it.  It was like I became lost in the Great Depression era.  I so wanted it to end so that I could hear the conclusion of Jacob's life with the circus, but I didn't want it to end because it was such an enjoyable book.  I liked the way the story was narrated by Jacob as a young man and as an old man.  It is hard to believe that this was not an autobiography.,overall
I loved this book!  It was refreshing,well written, a real page turner.  I would recommend this book for anyone over 15 who's looking for a good read.,overall
I read to learn and to be entertained.  Some books are more one than the other.  It doesn't matter as long as I'm fulfilled in some way.  I came to this book after I couldn't get past page 90 of one of the most boring books I have ever attempted to read by a contemporary highly regarded female author whose last name starts with P.  Maybe anything would have been interesting after that.  I found this book to be very entertaining and I even learned something.  I have never been to a circus or much cared about going to one.  Still, I was intrigued by the setting, the characters, and the story.Reading bestsellers can be a c*ap shoot.  I can't imagine what made \The Lovely Bones\ or \The Memory Keeper's Daughter\ bestsellers or why they were even published.  But books like this one and \The Kite Runner\ deserve their bestselling positions.  Then, there are other books like \The Memory of Running\ that deserve more attention than they get.  I guess what you like depends on your perspective.  I ran into a woman the other day who enjoyed \The Lovely Bones\, but she said it's because her daughter died recently and she liked to think her daughter was in a heaven like that one.,overall
OK - so I'm not an intellect....but I found this book to be absolutely wonderful.  I listened to it on CD as I travelled to and from work. It was well written and absolutely held my interest from beginning to end.  If you want John Steinbeck, then read John Steinbeck (as suggested from readers who don't share my enthusiasm).  In the meantime, enjoy this wonderful story and cry and laugh, as I did.,overall
This book was amazing.  It was very different from the books that I've been reading lately (thrillers, science fiction) and I would recommend it to anyone.  You got to know the characters, even the animals, and ended up feeling as if you were hearing a story about somebody you knew.  She did such a good job, and I hope that her others are just as good!,overall
Being a born horse-lover, I have read Sara's previous books about horses.  I loved them.  When I heard she had written another book-I just had to read that too.  Her writing style is very readable.  You become immersed in the characters.  \Water For Elephants\ is a book for all generations.  I had both my daughters read it.  We all fell in love with the main character, Jacob.  I can't say enough good things about this wonderful heartwarming book.  Highly recommend!,overall
Loved this book!  I'm hoping to encourage my book club members to read it too so we can discuss together.  One of those stories that keep you engaged and encouraged to keep reading to see what happens next.  I enjoy a book that makes you feel for the characters and this book does just that.  Plus, there were enough twists and turns that I didn't exactly know how it would end.  Great read and would recommend to other readers!,overall
I am glad I read the book. I still havent seen the movie, but the book was a good read.,overall
What a haunting cast of characters, true voices, detailed descriptions that went on just long enough, plot twist at the end... I devoured this book in just 24 hours. I keep thinking about Jacob and Marlena and August, and even Rosie. How wonderful that the author did so much research into the history; it really came alive for me. I can't wait for the movie! One of the best pieces of fiction I have read in some time.,overall
I found myself reading so many parts of this story to my husband they were so funny! This is definately a great book to read. A great story and a fast read, I loved it!(heard it was nothing like the movie though),overall
I loved this book it was hard to put down once I got used to the changing of times. ill probably read it again later.,overall
Great read. Even if I like a book it usually takes me a month to get through because I always end up falling asleep when I start to read, but I finished this book in 5 days tops!Sara Gruen's research and imagination paid off. I was impressed by how vividly I was able to see and feel all her characters. I have never been interested in the circus before, but this book wants me wants to read more.,overall
Very easy to read and very enjoyable. I could see the characters in my mind .Thanks Amazon Prime. Like the Arthur.,overall
This was a fabulous book.  It kept me spellbound and I simply could not put it down.  I would highly recommend this one,overall
Being  an animal lover  I truly  enjoyed this book. I could understand their feelings working with animals as I raised, trained horses for close to twenty years.,overall
I enjoyed the format of the story switching from past to present. I would recommend it to readers who enjoy history with their fiction.,overall
Perfect finale.  Loved every chapter.  Can't wait to see the movie!This book terrified me.  I loved it, but it really scared the *beep* out of me.  Starting off with total devastation, Jacob sets off into the great unknown following the rails.  Hungry and desperate, he jumps a train and discovers it's the circus train.  I know it's a love story and a mystery and a tale of brutality in a dangerous time in our history for men, women and animals!I love getting Twitter messages from Rosie (like my husband said, you know things are going to be OK when an elephant just tweeted you...),overall
Beautifully written!  This is a moving glimpse into small-town American life and how the circus played an important role in America's coming of age.,overall
This is not usually the type of book that I read but after hearing a lot about it I decided to give it a whirl. I was not disappointed!,overall
I read this book based ( embarrassingly) on the attraction of the trailer. however, upon reading the book, I have to say that it outperformed my wildest expectations. I loved the characters, their imperfection and their depth.  Gruen's Narrative is vivid, exciting, passionate, and at times heartbreaking. the personalities of the animals and their role in the main characters interaction (and livelihood) in and out of the circus; are really moving.  I also found it refreshing that the main character's reasons for join the circus are not the norm. I did find the leading lady a bit flat at times, and the summation at the end left a little to be desired, but the ending was still perfect.,overall
couldn't put it down. my husband would yell at me b/c i was keeping him up at night! Easy read!!,overall
The first half of the book has interesting details about life with a circus train along with some suspense, then the suspense increases.  Alternating between the old and young main character was great.  I love the way this was written.,overall
This is such a beautiful story. I enjoyed the story line and the characters and I felt that it was well researched also.,overall
This book is keeps you turning the pages after page. I did have some trouble getting through the abuse of animals as I am a lover  of all animals.,overall
This book is one of my all-time favorites because I loved the main character and the woman he fell in love with, but most of all, I loved the adventure of the traveling circus. Gruen had to have done a major league amount of research to learn what the circus was like in the 1920s. And my guess would be that she really did meet a man like the main character. Otherwise, how could he be so believable and so lovable?I have lent this book to several people. I know the author prefers to hear that everyone bought their own copy and I get it. But \Water for Elephants\ is a book everyone should read.,overall
It was a very exciting story. I loved the way it went back and forth from now to yesteryear. The characters seemed to real. Loved it.,overall
When I first read the title and the back of this book,  I wasn't the least bit interested.  However --- two of my sisters, my daughter,  and my niece were reading the book at the same time --- and all four of them loved it and recommended it highly.  I had to get it --- and I had to agree with them!  Its a great story!  One that is amost impossible to put down!  I highly recommend this read!  I just hope the movie doesn't ruin it.,overall
Liked this book a lot even after watching the movie found more entertainment in the book . The book is more for mature eyes as was the movie.,overall
the story was amazing and I found myself completely identifying with an octagenarian who ran away with the circus! A little unexpected for this 40 something mom. Read this. You will be transported.,overall
Loved this book!  The author really engaged my interest in the characters.  Such a great story and hurrah for the ending!!,overall
You will NOT be disappointed in this book; a real page-turner that you cannot put down! The characters and story are wonderful; I cannot wait for the movie.,overall
It's clear why this unusual work wound up on the NY Times Bestseller List, because it will appeal to a mass audience. It captures a time and environment that stirs the curiosity of young and old.  Who wouldn't be interested in exploring the dysfunctional dynamics of the circus family, during the perilous era of the early 30's. It allows you to finally be able to, run away to the circus, in the comfort and safety of your easy chair.  And, as intriguing as some scenes might be, it makes you just as glad you never did.While written simplistically, the messages run deep.  The cruelty that existed during those hard times and the effect on man and beast, were heartbreaking.  It was particularly difficult to envision the animal abuse and neglect, but it was so integral to the story that you had no choice.  It was a reminder, that left unchecked and unsupervised, that the weakest amongst us will frequently be delegated the scapegoats.  It was also a reminder of the evil that can be unleashed by man when faced with desperate times.Visiting the Senior Jankowski was particularly delightful.  A mere \90, or maybe 93,\ as he frequently chimed, his struggle to retain dignity and independence was inspirational and beautifully drawn out.  Gruen also did a great job moving seamlessly between the Senior Jankowski and his youthful, 23 year old counterpart. Sometimes I wouldn't even notice, even though decades separated the characters, when we'd moved from one to the other, which is not easily accomplished.  They were both struggling with the angst of the past, the ugliness of the moment and the uncertainty of moving forward.I've read reviews where some took exception to using Schizophrenia as an excuse for one of the characters cruelty and explosive episodes, as his behaviors were not typical for Schizophrenia.  And, they definitely weren't!  However, in the 30's Schizophrenia was not well understood and likely frequently misdiagnosed, becoming a catch-all for describing many signs of mental illness. I don't believe this should detract from the story.My grievances are few, but I did have some issues with the ending, which I found unrealistic, although I'm not sure we were intended to interpret the ending so concretely.  If you take it beyond face value, the ending can have some very deep meaning.  I think it depends entirely on the reader to decide for themselves.,overall
A really good read. A peek into the workings of the old time circus life along with memorable characters and storyline. Love the way the auther potrayed Jacob as a crochety old man. Couldn't put the book down.,overall
I really enjoyed it.  The insight into the circus world in the depression was very interesting, and it was well written.,overall
I just loved this book, it has one of the best endings i have read for a long time.  The writing is so good you feel that you are part of the circus, and that it was all true and not fiction.,overall
I felt like the elephant was almost a person.  I really enjoyed reading this book.,overall
Loved it!  This is a book you remember long after you have ready it.  Highly recommend.  It is a very moving book.,overall
i like the description, plus the reviews from the buyers are quite fantastic, so by the end of this month im going to buy this, im thinking though if i can wait for 3 weeks or just buy it on a bookstore nearby..hope i can find it if ever i will buy it from a store! so excited!,overall
Water for Elephants is a wonderful love story that takes place during 1930's America on the circus route.  The story is funny, historically factual and touching.  Animal lovers will enjoy Rosie and Queeny and all the members of the menagerie and the feel good end of this tale and its hero, Jacob.,overall
Just captivating....I found it incredibly easy to get wrapped up in this story and I fell in love with Jacob immediately. I look forward to more from Gruen.,overall
Take a glimpse into life in the circus in the 1930's with this wonderful piece of fiction.  The characters will captivate you.,overall
This enticing circus tale was spectacular. It made me laugh and fall in love, evicted anger and softened my heart. Truly lovely.,overall
Couldn't stop reading this book. i finished it in one day. hope the movie is as good as the book.,overall
Water for Elephants is a fresh engrossing tale told by a ninety something year old Jacob Janowski,who was a vet at a 5th rate circus for a summer in 1931.He meets a lot of interesting people at the circus ,one is a much picked upon depressed midget who is also a clown whose only friend is his dog, a goofy drunk hobo,named Camel and the beautiful Marlena,the secret object of Jacob's affection.Marlena performs some of the most amazing stunts with her elephant and horse act along with her physically abusive husband, August who is a paranoid schizofrenic and not above snuffing people out that get in his way.Jacob also paralels the way the circus life was with his present existance in a nursing home.He has recently lost his wife,and his kids are elderly too and cannot take care of him either.He makes friends with a nurse who just gets him and doesn't treat him like an invalid,& goes out of her way to make him happy.If you like a good story,with detailed,colored, stop my review immediately and please go get this book,overall
I loved this book. It was so sweet in an adult fairy tale sort of way. I enjoyed the characters, the description of the animals, the whole premise of the story. Long after I had finished, and recommended it to everyone I know, I still think about the characters, and miss reading about them.,overall
This is such a different setting than anything else I have read in the past.  It was refreshing.  Yeah there is a love story, but it doesnt take over the book.  I really enjoyed it.,overall
I have read this book three times over the past three years. The story is not only compelling, it is a very real look at what life 'B' circuses was really like. I had a great-uncle who worked in 'B' circus troops who told his stories of life in such  traveling troupes to my father who re-told those stories to me. I could not find one flaw is this re-count of circus life in the 1930s.,overall
Loved it, loved it, loved it.  Gruen 'feels' what it must be like to retain a facile mind but be trapped in an aging body.  What do we have left?  Our memories--the 'pictures' we have made through life that are filed away in our memory banks.  Props to Gruen for her obvious deep research into the time period, especially what circus life was really like during the depression (and beyond).  Her characters are engaging and true to form, and she uses them to weave a wonderful tale.  A great read.,overall
I really enjoyed this book. I never really had any interest in the circus, but this book has me wanting to go now. I love how you find out what is going on in the characters life now.,overall
This was an easy, entertaining and informative read.  I was enjoying reading this so much that I had my mom and a friend read it too on their kindle and they both loved it.  I wanted to read it for entertainment but ended up enjoying learning so much as well through the story.  I did not see the movie but now I might just to see how much justice they did to the book.  Plus I read it free from the Kindle Lending Library but it would have been worth buying!,overall
I picked this up not knowing a thing about it except the blurb, so I was pleasantly surprised to find this story of love and betrayal under the big top one of the most engaging tales I've read in a long while.  I'm not much into romance, but this is so much more than that so I couldn't pull myself away.  As a bonus I learned about the dark side of the circus industry during that era.  Gaslighting, where they throw the circus hands off the train in the middle of the night to avoid having to pay them, was a new term to me. Despite the cut-throat world they live in, the young veterinarian protagonist and the circus star he has a crush on, try to rise above it all at risk of life and limb.What tops it off is the story has one of the most satisfying endings I've encountered in a long time.  I've passed my book along to my mother and it has since gone through the hands of three of my sisters.  They all loved it.  I'm a big fan.,overall
What a great book.  When it was done, I wanted so much to have more to savor.  The detail and descriptions impressed me in this book; they were so nicely done, without having boring detail. Covering two differenttimes of Jacob's life - as a young man, then as an older gentleman.  Both funny and sad, and an enjoyable read.,overall
Once you start you can't stop! I devoured this book as fast as I could. Even when I wasn't reading it I was waiting until I could again. Fantastic story.,overall
This book was captivating from page 1.  The story kept a good pace and is one of those books you just don't want to put down.  I really connected with the main character and felt his emotions as if they were my own.  Other characters were both likable and despicable, but all the while intriguing.  A very interesting story and enlightening as well.  I can imagine life on a circus train during the depression and realize now that it was not all it was cracked up to be.  Highly recommend!,overall
Sara Gruen is a truly gifted writer. Water for Elephants follows a young man (Jacob) during depression-era America after he loses his entire family to a car accident. Soon after dropping out of vet school following the deaths, Jacob jumps a train that turns out to be a circus. The story is his coming of age story, with romance, violence, hilarious adventures and mystery. All set against the canvas of the larger than life traveling 'menagerie.'The story is told by Jacob as a 90+ year-old reminiscing about his days in the circus when one comes to town across the street from his retirement home - dredging up long-forgotten memories. I absolutely LOVE the ending where Jacob 'escapes' his retirement home on yet another adventure! Cheers to Gruen - I will look for more of her books. This one was superb!!,overall
I like getting lost in a novel.  That is, to get so involved in the storyline, I forget about my immediate environment.  Authors can achieve this goal by producing actions that borderlines the plausible.  When actions are too plausible, the novel becomes trite.  As a consequence, a reader will lose interest.  When the actions totally lack plausibility the reader becomes aware of one's immediate environment.  Within this scenario, the author forces the reader to assess the logic of the actions and the flow of the storyline is disrupted.  Somewhere between plausible and implausible is best for a storyline.Although Gruen is a talented writer with a rare command of the written word, her description of flunking out of Veterinarian school was too implausible.  EVEN Cornell professors would give a second chance if a student's parents died prior to comprehensive exams!  The implausible wrinkle forced me into reality throughout my reading experience.  It wasn't until the chapter 23 (page 314) when I realized that Gruen skillfully left out some critical information.  Thus, what seemed too implausible at the beginning became reasonable at the end.  We reach borderline plausibility.Yet, the novel doesn't end there.  A second storyline that Gruen skillfully weaves throughout the novel emerges into a second borderline plausible event.  The novel ends with an unexpected double whammy.WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a wonderful story.  It can best described as quirky with several unanticipated twists and turns.,overall
This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  A story that grabbed me and kept me wanting more.  A story of right and wrong, of revenge with a special twist.,overall
I was worried at first about reading this book because I hate to read about any animal cruelity and I imagined there would be some. My fears were partially  realized but I must say there was no gratuitous violence. Most of it was mentioned but not \shown.\ That being said, I absolutly loved this book. The characters were portrayed in such a way that you could feel the emotions and physical triumphs and pain. Poor Jacob loses his family in an accident and then learns his parents have no money.He in the meantime, is unable to finish his schooling for vetrinarian school.  My sheer coincidence he ends up being a vet for a circus. All of this is recalled in flashbacks by a 92 year old Jacob who lives in a nursing home. His wife is long passed away and his children have more or less deserted him. Without me giving too much of the book away, It is amazing how the reader can almost feel the dirt on their skin and the physical pain of the work all done for the purpose of putting on the best circus show ever.  The gossip and segregation of the performers were a sign of the times(during the early 1920's)  and how this could bring about chaos among workers all the way up to the performers. It is abook I could not put down and I read it in two days. I highly reccommend it!,overall
I didn't want to put it down. I could feel his misery as he sat in the nursing home. Behinds the scenes of the circus were great. It was easy to get to know all the character and care about some (hate others).,overall
After reading this I had to watch the movie. It was a great book & I would read it again & again,overall
I wasn't sure if I wanted to read this, but I picked it up at a garage sale on the cheap.  The storyline was completely engrossing and I couldn't put it down.  I know nothing about circus life, so I can't comment on whether or not the circus elements are factual.  I do have experience both working in and visiting nursing homes and the descriptions here sadly ring true.  A review on the cover described the book as gritty and sensual and it is certainly both in a very entertaining way.  One of the few books that I immediately wanted to read again as soon as I finished it!,overall
This book is awesome. I usually like to read the book first, and then see the movie. In this case I saw the movie first. So happy I still read the book. It captures so much more of the characters' essence.,overall
A story about doing the right thing and protecting those who can't protect themselves (animals or people). This novel had me hooked from the beginnning. Your heart will swell and break and swell again, but you won't be dissappointed.,overall
Great book. Kept my interest to the very end. Love the details about the circus. The ending was great. It was not the endingI expected.,overall
This book is one the best books I have ever read.  I read a lot of books. This was a very good story.,overall
I loved every moment of reading this book with the exception of the last 5 pages or so.  The ending, in my opinion, was forced, rushed, incredible, and slightly ridiculous.  To have this wonderful, beautifully written story end in such a way really did the story an injustice.  I still recommend reading it, because it was a beautiful story, and was fantastically written, but the ending left so much to be desired.,overall
A beautiful piece of fiction that you almost wish was true.  An uplifting story of love and redemption, a story of hope.,overall
I bought the book at Costco, and didn't have time to read it. So, when I saw the audiobook at the library, I immediately checked it out. It kept me enthralled through every minute. Loved the characters -- human and critter. And I found the story poignant and moving. The characters are very realistic, the era is intriguing, and the story will capture your heart.,overall
usually thebook is better than the movie but the movie was so wonderful.  It was one of the best I ever saw,  I can't recommend it enough.  It wasn't bloody.  It was wonderflu,overall
The book is so amazing and detailed that the movie may ruin it for you. This is a true adventure story of the circus life which really brings you in, makes you love the characters and have fun. You will not be able to put down this sexy, colorful and exhilerating novel. After reading, you will miss and want more of the story ....this is a fabulous must read for anyone looking for a spectacular story.,overall
The depth to which you become attached to these characters and the story,and their stories, is remarkable. I read this book in 2 days, which is a big deal considering I have a full time job, husband, and a 7 month old. Definitely recommend this book!,overall
Really great book. The characters are interesting, particularly our hero Jacob. The setting is vibrant (a circus during the Great Depression.) The plot moves at a great pace, and the material is really well researched. All of which comes together under some excellent writing that provides just enough detail to make everything real and interesting without banging you over the head with it. Throw in murder, sex and a big elephant wearing pink sequins, and you have a fab book. The very end is charming too. I highly recommend it,overall
I don't even know how to begin this review.  This book is so wonderful, and so very different from anything that I've read, that I still can't believe it.  Sara Gruen has written a book that is so carefully researched and so well-written that it puts the reader right into the story which is Depression-time circus life.  Jacob is a character that is so real, both as he's portrayed at a young age, and as he is portrayed as a 93 year old living with his memories in an old aged home.  The story is poignant and also sad.  It is quite heartbreaking to think of the way the animals lived that travelled with train circuses during this time.  And they had all manner of animals, from elephants to apes to zebras to horses to the big cats like lions and tigers.  They even had polar bears if you can imagine!  This book is dark in its portrayal of circus life circa 1920, but it's also heartwarming in Ms. Gruen's portayal of the many kinds of people that also travelled with these circuses.  These train circuses were an entire community and everyone in them was part of the family, including the animals.  The story is also a love-story that is so beautifully depicted amongst this varied kaleidoscope of characters and the wonderful animals.  And what about amazing Rosie?  She is an elephant that I will never forget!  A totally wonderful reading experience that I didn't want to put down, and that I'm now sad that I've finished.,overall
Change after a life disaster drives this wonderful tale of Jacob and his life for several months thereafter.  Jacob tells the tale himself as a nonagenarian some seven decades after the fact.  His final exams to end his veterinary medicine degree, and his anticipated life following graduation, come to a crashing halt, and leave him wandering aimlessly.  Without considering its consequences, and noticing no details of the train, he stows away on a passing one.  Having hopped a circus train, Jacob initially faces some ugly hardships before his training leads him to his responsibility in the show.  Along the way, Jacob encounters challenges and loyalties, well-meaning others and some with decidedly despicable intentions and/or means.  The characters, the lovely and good-hearted Marlena, who is the star of the show, and her husband August, who is volatile in many unappealing ways, as well as Kinko/Walter, Jacob's initially disgruntled roommate, are reasonably strong secondary characters,  This reader wishes that Marlena had been fleshed out better, but that's a minor complaint.  Jacob is terrific, flawed as Gruen says she wishes of her characters, and a good man placed in difficult circumstances, a circus where the rules don't make much sense, particularly if one holds egalitarian views of one's co-workers.  This reader found the practice of redlighting to be totally repugnant, and frankly a bit upsetting.  Jacob's interaction with the members of the Menagerie, the animals, repeatedly shows his appropriateness for his career.  Several of the animals' personalities stand out.  Jacob in his youth adapts sometimes well and sometimes badly.  Gruen handles Jacob as an old man nicely, making him whole and believable with the challenges of his age, but still generally holding onto his faculties and sense of independence.  Rosemary, one of his nurses, is a lovingly and warmly portrayed woman.  Without spoilers, the ending is terrific, too.  The pacing and flow of the writing help move this gracefully.  Wonderful reading and I've already been looking into more Gruen.,overall
I have seen Water for Elephants  at all the popular bookstores for the last year.  It never appealed to me, so I always passed over it.  This month, it was choosen as my book club's choice and I was pleasently suprised.  It was a true page turner and I finished the book in one weekend.  Gruen captured the time period and the secret world of circus people during the Depression beautifully.  It made me want more and to know more about the people of that era who worked on the circus trains.You won't be disappointed.,overall
I can see why so many were talking about this book.  It is a wonderful story, with such rich character description you feel like a character in the book.  I loved it and would recommend to all my friends.,overall
Just don't try to read too much into it. It's a fantastic idea and the ending is a bit too romantic and incredible, but it's a great book that really makes you think over human nature and love.,overall
I am an animal lover and elephants are my favorite! Reading this story I laughed, cried, smiled and grew angry. Makes me rethink supporting circuses,overall
I enjoyed reading this book - it was hard to put down. It is a lovely love story with several twists and turns.  I loved how it showed the emotions of the elephant, which made me fall in love with her even more.  It reminded me a lot of the &#34;Notebook&#34;, going from present time to past through the main character's memory.  This is definately a must read for the romantic at heart.,overall
This is a book that grabs you from the beginning. It's a fantastic story that keeps you interested the whole way through. And it's a quick read. I just loved it so much. It's something for everyone, from the historical interest in the life of the traveling circus people during the depression, to the descriptions of old age in a nursing home. I actually insisted my husband read it when I was done. He's not an easy man to please, but had to admit how much he enjoyed it as well. I purposely don't want to say too much about the story since I enjoy reading books \fresh\ without too much advance information. The only negative I would say is that the ending was bit unbelievable to me. But by that time everything else was so great, I didn't really care. It was as though the author was all done and didn't know how to end it. But I can forgive that.,overall
Outstanding!Refreshing new topic, new ideas, utterly wonderful.A dark comedy, love-story about a circus during the Depression. The characters are developed and strong. The plot not missing a beat. And the animals, gotta love the animals and their personalities!Jacob is in vet school, until he drops out suddenly. He leaves his exam and walks all night until he no longer can manage another step. As he rests, a train comes down the tracks, in the middle of nowhere. He runs as fast as he can and jumps the train. It's all over as Jacob discovers he is on a carnies-train! He befriends \Camel\, a circus hand who recruits Jacob to join.Interesting, dark, and wonderfully full. They style and measure by which M. Gruen writes is so welcoming and it is evident by her comments that she paid attention to details in her research.Would definitely read again!5 out of 5,overall
I don't read a lot of fiction these days because I don't havethe time, but I picked this book up from my Mom over my summervacation...And boy was I glad I did. Some books do more thancapture your mind; they create a certain feeling or emotionthat captures your heart too. This is one of those books.The author's voice has a certain cadence and style that sucksyou in from page one. And what seems to be a simple tale ofdepression-era circus life with an obvious outcome soon takesunexpected twists and turns to a surprise ending that had melaughing and crying at the same time.If you read one novel this year, I'd highly recommend this one.It ranks right up there with many of my all time favoritebooks.,overall
Loved it! This book had everything! Villans, heros, romance, monkeys and elephants. What more could you want? I loved how the story was weaved between past and present times. It was beautifully written and helped capture a part of our American past that I had never been exposed to before. I literally laughed and cheered (embarassingly) along the way, and talk about a grand finale!,overall
This was very different from the books I normally read but I was unable to put it down. It's an easy fun read.,overall
I enjoyed the book. It was captivating and entertaining start to finish with some creative twists along the way. Can't wait to see the movie now.,overall
I really enjoyed this book! It took me back to watching the circus train go through Devils Lake State Park when i was young. Great job by the author in educating herself on circus life and history.,overall
What a delightful book. I was hesitant at first to pick up, but so very glad I did.  It had me in it's clutches on the first page, and I couldn't put it down until the last.  What a wonderful cast of characters, both good and evil. I have recommended to many, and hopefully they will read as well.  Thank you Sara, for such a good time!,overall
I loved this book and was so sorry when I finished it! I liked the characters and they were very life-like. It was one of the best books I've read in a very long time and is way at the top of my favorites list! I will read it again and again!,overall
What a wonderful balance between how an older person in declining health must feel, with all of its frustrations and grief and loneliness--and the exciting story of a young man and a circus and love and passion and jealousy... the animals are portrayed with sensitivity and the \freaks\ are shown in all of their humanity.  An excellent read.,overall
The details about circus life were brought to life and were enthralling.  This book was a page turner and I emensely enjoyed it.  Finished it in 5 evenings.  Only downside was that there were 3 or 4 \raunchy\ scenes that we could have done without.  I found myself just skipping over these pages.  All in all, loved the story.  Felt like I was a spectator at the real thing.,overall
Every now and then a story comes along that leaves a lasting impression.  This was one of them.  I loved the story, the story-line was good and the character development was great.  I'd definately recommend this book to anyone.,overall
I read this book before seeing the movie.  The book, of course, is much better than the movie.  Everyone wants to run away and join a circus right?  Well I wanted to when I was younger!  I love this author and her style of writing.  She draws you in right away and you feel as if you really know her characters!  Even if you saw the movie...Read the book!,overall
WOW. It's been a long time since I read a book this good--I was so sad when it ended!  I kept wishing I could share more of Jacob's amazing life--and the ending, what a boffo finish.  I would have NEVER guessed that one! This is much beyond a good \summer read\--how is it this book did not hit #1??  I love historical fiction, and I am usually very 'into' the time period and the 'feel' of the era...this one was particularly evocative; you could swear you smelled the animal cars, the greasy scent of the carnie food, the whiff of the stale sleeping quarters.  I could almost feel sweet Rosie's pain at the hands of the cruel August; and when he met his fate, I cheered Rosie like she was a hero (she's an ELEPHANT).  What a rich read--if you begin it, make sure you don't need to sleep that night!,overall
I purchased this book per recommendation and thoroughly loved the book. Great storyline and an enjoyable read, it has become one of my favorites.,overall
Really interesting!  Read this book--you won't be sorry!  Loved it, quite unique and kept my interest well.  Give it a try!,overall
This was a very romantic and sweet book.  In the beginning I found Jacob to be very real; moving and sympathetic.  Ahh, but then the circus comes to town and we're back to his youth ...The travails of working in a traveling circus are real and riveting; the details seem accurate.  At times I thought the author lost her voice but for the vast majority of this book, I enjoyed it a great deal!,overall
Great premiere book from this author. I thoroughly enjoyed the read. It gives a ringside appreciation for life in the traveling bigtop.,overall
excellent---sorry I waited so long to read it  never saw the movie yet either!Guess I'm just late with everything,overall
First, let me say that the book is somewhat graphic compared to what I usually read so if you're something of a prude, put it back.  That having been said, I LOVED this book!!  I loved the character of Old Jacob and the treatment of him as an old man - how true to life and how we all wish it wasn't really true, but it is.  I felt the characters were adequately developed over the course of the book - this may irk some reviewers because they want to know everything about everyone in Chapter 1 - well, I say, read on and you'll find out what you need to know to empathize with them.  The only thing I felt wasn't fleshed out was what Camel had done to his family that he didn't want to go home to them, but since it wasn't pertinent to the story line, I'm OK with that.  The character of Young Jacob was somewhat \victim\ rather than \victor\ but I felt that was accurate based on the circumstances in which he found himself, and I appreciated his feeling of impotence at changing his circumstances.No, this is not literature, folks, this is a highly enjoyable story that is riveting, engaging, and gives us a glimpse into another era and another lifestyle.  I highly recommend it!,overall
I must confess I had to listen to the audio version of this because I'm not allowed to open my Kindle until Christmas.  Either way, this was the best book I've \read\ in a very long time.  I think I could understand Jacobs feelings about being in the nursing home since I had to deal with my mom being in a nursing home.  His description about sitting in the dining room was so real.  Do yourself a favor and enjoy it.  Also, it has a great ending.,overall
Went into this with an attitude because of the over-exposure it was receiving, but my reservations quickly faded and I was actually flying through the pages to an unexpected, heart-warming ending.,overall
This was a very entertaining book.  I never would have guessed I would like a book about a circus.  But I loved it.  When I first started it, I didn't know how it was going to be, but I never stop reading a book without finishing it, so I read on.  The storyline sucked me in deeper and deeper, until I was hooked, and by the end of the book, I was not  ready for it to be finished.,overall
Just finished this wonderfully colorful novel & I was not disappointed.....Once I started reading,I could NOT put it down...Loved the circus setting,strong characters and animals...Now I cannot wait to see the movie...One of the best stories I have read all year....And the author very realistically portrays what it actually means to get older...I'm not as old as the elder Jacob yet but each year that goes by,I can tell the difference in the physical abilities....If you are looking for entertainment,this book will provide it.,overall
I had to read this book twice, that's how much I enjoyed it. Then I saw the movie. Great, heart wrenching story, great characters . . . I won't soon forget this story.,overall
Since acquiring my Kindle, I've started playing a new game.  I download \samples\ of all kinds of books.  If I can get hooked in the first few chapters, well clearly the author deserves the book sale.That is exactly what happened with Water for Elephants.  Almost immediately I was completely drawn into the story.  Ms. Gruen uses an effective framing device for her tale.  Nonagenarian Jacob Jankowski is telling his story in flashbacks from his present in a nursing home.  And it is the story of his first job out of veterinary school.  The year is 1931 and the country is embroiled in the Depression.  Tragedy sends Jacob fleeing his orderly life.  Without trying to, the young man winds up running away to the circus.Water for Elephants is a coming of age novel, a buddy tale, a period drama, and a love story.  It's one of those rare novels that seems to captivate almost all readers.  I came late to it, but I was as entranced as all those who have raved before me.  Gruen's prose is strong, but it's her characters and setting that capture the imagination.  I haven't been to a circus in decades, and have no particular interest in that life.  But Sara Gruen is a fantastically gifted storyteller, in the most elemental sense of the word.  I will be grabbing future novels upon publication.  Highly recommended to all who crave a great story!,overall
I have yet to watch the movie and I kept picturing miss Reese Whitherspoon throughout the novel. It was great and it made you think of the world from a different point a view. I never realized it...you forget the viewpoint of the story and how it is being told your are sucked right in. It is a great love story and I think the movie will be fantiasticly bold and beautiful.Movie and book are masterfuly mirrored. First time I can say both are in tune with each other.,overall
I put off reading this book, even though it was recommended by friends. I thought I had no interest in a circus book. I was wrong. I am glad I read this story, and learned from it as well. Like others have said better than I, it is brutal, real, historical, entertaining, with a dash of romance thrown in. You don't have to be a circus fan to like this book, it's message will linger with me.,overall
Excellent read.  One of the best books I have read in a long time.,overall
I loved this book!  It was different than anything else I've ever read.  I didn't want to put it down at all.  Just the right amount of romance and intrigue.  There were times that I actually cried, its been a long time since I've read anything that moved me to tears!  Highly recommend!,overall
The main character I can sympathize with and can appreciate. You can really imagine what it would be like to be in his shoes in this book. It does a great job of explaining what that particular circus was like back then. I couldn't really picture it until I was able to read the book. Im glad I read it. No complaints! Especially if you love animals!!!,overall
From the first page to the last, I was hooked on this book.  I found the juxtaposition between the past and present fascinating and the peek into the tent of circus live mesmerizing.  I read this book in one setting and loved every page.  Highly recommend!,overall
Sara Gruen's prose is straightforward and simple, her research of Depression-era circus life impeccable.  With a gentle hand, she transports the reader back to a time and place most of us could never imagine. Along the way, her rich characters--Jacob, the young protagonist whose world implodes as he readies himself for life as a veterinarian, Marlena, the beautiful circus performer he falls in love with, and August, her psychotic husband and head trainer of the 'Worst Show on Earth'--leap off the page.  Water for Elephants is a rickety train ride into the dark, seedy, melancholy world of the 1930s circus performer.  But it's a trip worth taking.  Your final destination is not a place of misery and despair but one of love and hope.  And the ending is guaranteed to soften the hardest of hearts.Salmon Run,overall
This book is amazing! I couldn't put it down! Not much more to say except wonderful writing and absorbing story line. Also, it's great that the Kindle edition is under $4.50.,overall
First the title, Water for Elephants is quite interesting. It catches my eye and has been since I saw it on the bookshelf. Finally with a copy of my own, Sara Gruen's writing style is quite detailed and specific but she has abundant of information and allows the reader to understand Jacob Jankowski, the widowed 90 year old man. In writing about the loss of his parents, he writes how he discovered that his parents mortgaged their home to send him to Ivy league college, probably Cornell University. He drops out and finds himself working at the circus by providing water for elephants. We know he was married for 60 years. The sccene in the lawyer's office discovering his parents' lack of estate was heartbreaking and typical depression era story. The fact that the great depression and stock market crash of 1929 is still relevant in today's literature. Sara Gruen makes accountability for explaining the details of Jacob Jankowski's life.,overall
i loved this book it brought tears to my eyes. growing up you visit the circus but very rarely do you consider the pains that it took to get to that happy place. the love story mingled in with the tales of the circus it is a shocking ending that most wont see coming.,overall
I just finished \Water for Elephants\ and would recommend it to anyone who wants a good read with compelling characters and engrossing storyline.  I just couldn't put this down which is unusual for me.  I loved both stories - the old man reaching the end of his life and the young vet who joins the circus out of desperation during the depression.  You can't go wrong with this one.,overall
Such an engaging story!  I fell in love with the main character.  If this is an accurate depiction of circus life, I'm so glad I never joined the circus!!,overall
Never saw the movie but truly enjoyed the book. I think every kid (especially two generations ago) wanted to run off and join the circus. Seemed like such a glamorous life on the road, wearing glittering costumes, etc. This book gave the child in me a behind the scenes look at life on the road with the circus. And I can empathize with the passion Jacob has his memories. Quick read.,overall
If the first few paragraphs can't hold my interest, I can't read a book. I couldn't stand to put this book down! I could visualize throughout the entire story. I hated for it to end.This book far exceeded my expectations.,overall
This just became one of my favorite all time reads. It is super easy and fast but such a great story of the depression and the very (who knew) interesting life of a circus. Inspiring, a great moral to the story on how to look at life as you grow old.One of those books that you almost feel sad finishing because you love the story so much.,overall
This was an incredible book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Every time I sat down to read this book, it transported me back to the 1930s. I would read it again.,overall
I always know that the book is better than the movie, but as I saw the movie first, sometimes I get a little bored with th  book. Not in this case, I saw the movie and have to say I loved it. And the book of course was just as good, yes better. I couldn't put the book down. Wonderful read!!!,overall
This novel is a great read-- I found it impossible to put down, from the very beginning. The characters are wonderful, and the sub-plots involving Walter (the dwarf) and the main character really make the whole story exciting. I honestly could not tell how the book was going to end until the last dozen pages, even though the first chapter contains quite a bit of foreshadowing-- I was still second-guessing my assumptions until the very end. I didn't know what was going to happen to the characters that I loved, or if there was going to be a happy ending, or whether it would be sad. I just wasn't sure.I love it when great books keep me guessing. Absolutely one of the best books I've read all year.,overall
Someone asked me the other day to list my favorite books of all time...this book definitely ranks in the top 10!  Gruen charmed me with the characters and made me want to go back in time to the depression era circus. I really wish I had read this unforgettable novel years ago.,overall
This is one of those books that, when the end comes you want to flip it over and start again.  It begins with a scene from the climax of the book - a real page-turner.  A fantastic hook!Action bounces from \present day\, then back to the 30s, then back again. Both settings appear to be thoroughly researched and are written with authority.  The author IS a 93 year old man AND a 20-something circus vet - even though she is a young woman.You will NOT be able to put this book down.,overall
This was a great book, the only problem was I finished it too quickly because it was so good!,overall
This is a wonderful book. One of the best I have read. You will love it..such realistic characters. great story.,overall
Really a great read...Enjoyed it very much.  After completing the book read the back to find out was based in part on actual events from the past!,overall
I am so glad I read this book, it really gives you the real picture of what goes on behind the world of the people who are part of the &#34;BIG SHOW &#34; This was another book that you can picture all that is going on, it was fantastic.,overall
I admit I bought this book after reading the great reviews and because Robert Pattinson is currently filming this movie and I really enjoyed the story. So much I am reading again. I am so looking forward to the movie when it comes out next year. I recommend this book.,overall
I'd been seeing this book pop up on amazon as a recommended read for such a long time and kept resisting reading it. I didn't watch the movie either. I finally gave in to see what all the hype was about and I couldn't put this book down! It was one of the best books I've read in a long time! It kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. I loved it!,overall
What a fun read-although gritty and gruesome in places- this book really takes you into the lives of the characters and is a satisfying and enjoyable read.  I loved the ending! I was rooting for Jacob to get to the circus and so glad no one stopped him.  Since I am a nurse it made me cringe a little at the nursing home treatment of the elderly and it reminded me to always remember that every patient has their story.,overall
Shame on you if you ever look at an old person again and don't remember they were once young and had the world by the tail.Jacob is now ninety or ninety-three, he can't remember, and is living out his last years in a nursing home treated as belligerent and cantankerous.He sits a lot and while he sits, recalls his life in the circus.  It is an amazing and fantastic story. And so I don't write a spoiler I will simply say, I couldn't put the book down!,overall
From the very beginning of this book I found myself being pulled into the story. The writer's style is easy to read and the vivid pictures being painted are like watching a movie. If you can not get beyond the fact that the love affair is an adulterous one, then you might not like that part of the story, but I haven't met anyone who has read it that couldn't get past that detail to be able to enjoy the great story. I was able to buy this one while it was on sale, but I wouldn't have been disappointed at twice the price. If you are not sure yet, then get the sample and see for yourself what a great book this is.,overall
I loved this story. The film prompted me to purchase it and I'm glad that I did. It didn't garnish rave reviews, but I think the film did the book justice.,overall
I LOVED this book!  The three parts I loved the most were the beginning, the middle and the end.  Great books are far and few between and I am always happy to find one I can't put down.  If you want to get to bed early or get your house work done, don't read this book.  If you don't mind drinking an extra cup of coffee in the morning and putting the dishes off until later than by all means read this book.  Soooooo good.,overall
Great summer read! Never saw the movie, but really enjoyed reading the book. Fell in love with the main character.,overall
I can read about any subject if the characters are compelling, and I am amazed at the rich characters in this novel. Historical fiction at its finest!,overall
The author has obviously done her homework, because this book contains the argot, the excitement, the turmoil of a down-and-out circus during the Depression.  One can smell the sawdust, the animals, and the people in this graphic story of a young man who runs away with the circus.  It is told through the eyes of a nonagenarian, and although the ending is predictable, one keeps reading for the final denouement.  It is inevitable that there will be a disaster and that Rosie, the elephant, will cause it.  The narrator's desire to once more be a part of the circus is understandable, but its happening is a little far-fetched, considering the way nursing homes are run.  However, the ending is happily satisfctory, and we will not drink lemonade the next time the circus comes to town.,overall
This is a definite must read. i loved the way the author  protrayed the real lives of circus socity. recomended for young adult to adult,overall
It's not always that a popular novel lives up to the hype...but this one absolutely does!What I most enjoyed about this book was that it was unique from most other books that I've read.  I was transplanted to a place and time that I'd never been or really thought about before...a LIFE I'd never thought about.  It was really fascenating and I learned quite a bit about the circus, although some I didn't want to know.  I will caution that this book has some very graphic animal abuse scenes.Overall the story kept me reading, the characters and their lives were interesting and dynamic...even though some were not likeable.  The time passed quickly as I was reading, I was curious to see how it would end.  I dare say this was one of the better endings to a novel that I've read, I'd put it up that high for sure.  Full circle.,overall
Wonderful characters bring this story so completely to life I couldn't put it down.Excellent imagining of circus life and unexpected plot to boot.,overall
I'll defer to the others who have praised this book, and will skip the details. Basically I cannot say enough good things about this book.  The less one knows about the plot going in the better it is.There was one phrase Gruen wrote that was absolutely brilliant.  Referring a group of circus patrons, she describes them as \a swell of rubes.\,overall
I loved the book and watched the movie after...a fabulous story. Excellent job of incorporating the depression and historical references. A tale of love, friendships, growth and death.  Awesome!!!!,overall
This book was awesome!  I really couldn't put it down...one of those books where I try to get somewhere early just so I have time to read while I wait.  I bought it because I saw that the movie was coming out...and I always like to read a book before the movie.  I was NOT disappointed and now am anxiously awaiting the movie release.  I loved it how it went back and forth between Jacob's time in the circus and his life at age 94.  A wonderful love story...but it was much more than that! I highly recommend!,overall
I won't belabor the readers with a blow by blow of the plot; it is ably covered by other reviews.  Know this--that this is a great book, rated a 6 on a scale of 1 to 5 and far superior to the ordinary fare out there today.  If you are middle-aged or older, this will bring back memories of the old circuses and carnie-shows; if you are younger, this is a history lesson.  Regardless of age, you will thoroughly enjoy this book.,overall
I loved every minute of this book! I was surprised that I actually laughed more times than I thought I would.  Old-timey Jacob Jankowski is ten times funnier in the book, than he is in the film (I own both). I was able to appreciate the differences between the book & movie, and think that both are equally sturdy in entertainment value.  I loved the bonus features of the book which included actual circus pictures & an interview with Sara Gruen, discussing her writing process, in the end.  The only disappointment I had, was that the pictures were really small on my Kindle, so you couldn't always see them clearly.  I have no idea what they look like in the actual book, but it would've been nice (for the Kindle version, at least) to dedicate one full page, or half a page to the circus pictures.  This book also got me a lot more interested in the ins & outs of the circus industry in the 1930's & 40's... I also wonder if any of those  same practices & rumored practices continue today.  This book was very thought provoking & entertaining. I didn't want the story to end!,overall
I've seen the book from time to time, but the cover never intrigued me enough to actually buy and read it. Now I wish I had picked it up the first time I saw it! It is a delightfully different story of a 93 year old man who tells his story of his years in the circus through flashbacks. The topics are obviously well researched and that adds something special to the novel. It is a very engaging read and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a lighter, different type of book.,overall
This book was a great read. It's simple to follow and very descriptive. I will admit that I bought the book to read once I heard a movie was being made from it, but it surpasses the movie in great lengths! The movie was sorta like this book but not completely. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.,overall
This was an excellent read - well-developed characters in both past and present - could actually see the people and the scenes automatically as I read.  Very hard to put down and I wanted more when it was over.  I have added more to the story in my own mind, but would have been very happy to read the authors version of a continued story.  This was one of the better books I have read in recent years.,overall
Sometimes a one line summary that says very little can be rather enticing. For me, this is the case for WATER FOR ELEPHANTS. THE NEW YORK TIMES bestseller list summarizes the book by saying \A young man and en elephant save a Depression era circus.\ It made me want to purchase the book just to see how it happens. One could argue as to whether the one sentence summary is an apt description of the book, but whether a reader agrees with the summary or not, most will agree that WATER FOR ELEPHANTS turns out to be a novel well worth exploring.The book tells the story of Jacob Janowski, a young man with a promising career ahead of his as a partner in his father's veterinary practice. Jacob looses everything upon the accidental and sudden death of his parents. Not sure of how to proceed, Jacob decides not to take his veterinary exams and wanders. He finds himself on a train and before he knows it he's put to work. He soon discovers he's now a member of the crew with the Benzini Brothers' Circus, a rag tag outfit that claims to be \The Most Spectacular Show on Earth\ and has a true hatred for the far superior \Greatest Show on Earth Ringling Brothers. His credentials are soon discovered and the circus owner sees that his medical skills are put to good use. As he travels from town to town he gets involved in the inner workings of the circus, falls in love and develops a number of friendships both with circus members and the animals, most notably \Camel,\ a man severe alcoholic, Walter/Kinko, a performer, the lovely Marlena and her husband August, as well as a chimp named Bobo and an elephant named Rosie.The book is more than a story about a young man who runs away with the circus. When we meet Jacob, he's not a young man.  He's in his nineties and living in a nursing home. His body is failing but his mind is sharp, but few people notice because it's assumed by many of the staff of the nursing home he's like the other patients, most of whom have Alzheimer's or some form of dementia. He's lonely and knows that no one would understand or believe his story.Juxtaposing the older Jacob with the story itself is where we see author Sara Gruen's gifts as a writer. Her telling of the young Jacob's adventures is storytelling at its best. We feel as if we're traveling with the Benzini Brothers' circus and the situations that occur and the people who populate the story are real. Yet we also feel for the older Jacob, a man who is truly trapped, perhaps with the best of intentions by who love him, but none the less trapped. Readers do become emotionally involved in so many sections of the book.  You almost want to find out where this nursing home is, go and visit Jacob, take him out for dinner and drinks and make him tell the story. He's that memorable a character.The hardcover version of this book did well, and the paperback version seems to be following suit. No doubt it will be a favorite for book clubs across the country, and no doubt it will move readers for years to come. While it may be clich&eacute; to say so, this is a book that will not easily be forgotten.,overall
I loved it! The cast of characters and the details ..awesome. I could almost hear the circus music and see the animals.  I give this book  five stars and recommend it to anyone who loves animals and loves a good old story.,overall
I had heard mixed reviews about both the book and the movie and was a little wary of both, but when prime gave a free month subscription I figured it was worth at least trying the book.  I loved it!  I found it to be very witty - I absolutely fell in love with the 93 year old Jacob, and the historial aspect was very interesting... I never knew the history of the circus before reading this or what a great competivie market it was back in its hayday!  I will never look at the workers of a traveling show the same way again. I thought the book was a little slow paced for my taste but well worth it.  I even went ahead and watched the movie and found the book to be far more superior in context.  Great read!,overall
I loved this book. Regardless of what others have said about the authors writing, she did fabulous. Great story line, great characters. A little graphic is some scenes but wonderfully written. Can't wait to watch the movie even though I know it won't be as good.,overall
Circus life is hard. I was very happy with the book and the movie that came after. They kept to the book for the most part. Very enjoyable,overall
The story is unique and mesmorizing.  Though some parts are uncomfortable and heartbreaking, this author brings you through the misery with an assurance of better things ahead.  Ms. Gruen truly has a gift.  I look forward to reading more from her in the future.,overall
This  was one of my favorite readings.  It is well written, humorous and clever and never left me with the feeling of wanting more. Each section that was written in the present had me eagerly anticipating getting back to the past to find out what happened next and the ending was exactly as it should have been!,overall
This was one of the better books I've read on Kindle!  It was funny, sad, brutal, mean, and funny again!  It is told through the eyes of a 90 or 93 year old former circus employee.  He just can't remember how old he is at the time he is telling the story.After living through tragedy after tragedy while growing up, he finally finds himself befriended by a travelling circus crew who convinces him to tag along.  He does so and ends up caring for the animals as a veternarian even though he hasn't yet set for his final exams.  However, he did attend a pretty good school, so who cares about a piece of paper?  Once there, the story of a love affair, and friendships developed, and life as a \carny\ takes you through some pretty rough territory before it ends in such a way, it leaves you laughing again at the very end!  (including a little tear in the eye as well)Well written and well researched.,overall
I couldn't wait to read this book, and I was certainly not disappointed!  It was extraordinary and wonderful. I couldn't stop reading it.  The characters just about leapt off the page with their intensity.  I loved it so much! The movie couldn't do it justice after reading the book.,overall
Very good book I totally enjoyed  it.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great book to read.,overall
This book was out of this world. We have a story that goes back and forth between past and present, sometimes a present that he can't remember much of. Our hero is twenty-three and almost ready to take his final exam, when he receives word that both of his parents were in a car accident and have passed away. Leaving no money and feeling desperate Jacob jumps on a moving train. Having no idea he has jumped on a circus train, he decides he has nothing left and starts working with the circus.He meets a beautiful woman, but finds out quickly she is married to a mad-man. However, she returns the attraction and we have a great love story, combined with their love of animals. This story was so rich with character details I just couldn't put it down.When the book starts, it made me think Marlena brought the stake down on August's head, but that isn't the case. Just wait till you find out who did! What a book. Took my breath away with a great story line. A true weaver of stories, thank you Ms. Gruen.,overall
I enjoyed reading this book.  It kept my interest and I learned about the world of the traveling circus. I had no knowledge of this world.  It was a very hard life for these people.  Working so hard day in and day out and not getting paid.  I knew elephants were very smart animals but Rosie was wonderful.  I liked her spunk. I thought the story going back and forth from the present to the past kept the book interesting.,overall
A friend recommended this book for me. I got the sample yesterday morning for my kindle and bought the remainder soon after and finished it today. What a great book. So refreshing.,overall
A hard book to put down. Enjoyed every single minute of it. If you are an animal lover of any kind you will enjoy.,overall
I loved Water for Elephants. Author Sara Gruen managed to place herself in the head of both a ninety-year-old man with Alzheimers in a nursing home, and a twenty-three-year-old man who had a great life ahead of him until tragedy struck. She swung back and forth between the character's present drab life to the unpredictable depression era circus of his youth so naturally that I was amazed how often I forgot I was reading a book. I was so entranced by the scenery and story that it just flowed along like I was watching it, or more accurately, living it with the characters. It's not often storytellers do this good a job in our generation. I have recommended this book to many people. Gruen is a writer to watch.,overall
Ok so I admit. I did watch the movie first; but this book is AMAZING! Way better then the movie. I had a very hard time putting this one down. Also, there was so much more in the Book then the movie. It makes me wish that the movie had reflected more of the book then it had.,overall
I love when you open a book and start reading, and you visualize yourself right there.  Not only do you see things, you can smell the aromas in the air, and you are stopped just short of touching.  You stand there witnessing the events going on around you.  You can not stop them, you can not change them, but you are feeling the feelings of everyone there.  I did not want this book to end.  This book had me emotional from the beginning to the end, and even beyond.,overall
I'm not sure how to do this book justice except to say it is the first novel I've read cover-to-cover in a single day since my baby was born a year ago. Frankly, I wasn't sure it was even possible to read a book in a day with an infant in the house. But if the book is good enough (and the nap schedule cooperates) - rest assured, it can be done.Water for Elephants is told by the curmudgeonly Jacob Jankowski, whose miserable monotony of mushy peas and callous nurses is interrupted when a traveling circus sets up outside his rest home. The sight launches him into a reverie of his post-college days as a veterinarian in a depression-era circus. Gruen's gritty, visceral descriptions of circus life - the downtrodden animals, the sleazy side shows, the glamour of the big top - are matched only by her honest characters (who are imminently lovable and hate-able) and her fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into what has been - at one time or another - a dream for most of us...to run away and join the circus.,overall
I really enjoyed this book.  I think that no matter what type of genre of books you're into, you'll probably like this one.,overall
This book was so fun to read!  The stories he tells takes you back to the circus as a kid - yet it still has the love story and villians.  I can't wait for the movie!,overall
I really enjoyed this book.  If you've ever attended a circus, it makes you wonder about the lives of the performers and people behind the scenes.  The main character is interesting and sometimes sad.  However, the ending is great!,overall
I loved this book.  It has history, suspense and a romance all in one!,overall
Great book! Never read a book like this before but it really brings to life the [train] traveling circus experience from an insider's 'learn as you go' POV during the Depression era. There is such an ominous feel throughout the entire book that I never expected an ending as such... I actually thought it would be more depressing, but I'm not disappointed.,overall
Certainly there's a spark of magic at the circus. We felt the under vibes that freely flowed in our youthful visits to the show. In a generation that had various cartoon animals create the circus for our amusement we knew there was meore to the real ways circuses magically came together for that one night.Go on a journey to the real circus.Am so excited that this was on kindle lending. Huzzah to the writer for taking us to the real show!!!!!!,overall
This was a great book! Once I started reading it...I could not stop! The story is so interesting especially for those my age, in the twenties. Sadly...I feel as though there are not as many circuses out there so learning about the circus life was pretty neat!I also really liked the flashbacks from current times to the circus times. Great story!,overall
I enjoyed this book so much.  So much, in fact, I was sad when it was over.  Definitely worth the money.,overall
This book is one of the best books I have ever read!  I would recommend this book to everyone and have already passed it on to my Mother who also LOVED it!!  This is one of those books that stick with you and even when you've moved onto other books, you'll find yourself thinking about it still.  I will NEVER look at an elephant or a circus in the same way.  I laughed and cried several times and just can't say enough good things about this book.  It is one of those books that I don't think I will ever forget, it touched me very deeply.,overall
I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this book. From the opening line on Chapter 1 all the way to the end, you are hooked.A young veterinary student loses is parents tragically during the time of the depression. After having his family house repossesed by the bank and no prospects, he winds up working in a circus.As stated in other reviews, there are some shaky transitions and predictable plot points. But there is a sincerity to the book that works and unique setting that makes one easily forgive the story's few shortcomings.And it's the setting that I really liked about this book. It brings back the circus of old and it made me miss it. The smell of animals and hay. The popcorn and cotton candy. The acrobats with the sequined vests. You get a wonderful \behind the scenes\ insight to a peice of nostalgic Americana. Combined with classic dramatic elements and a motley cast of characters, this is a great book and I'm glad I got it.,overall
This is by far one of the most entertaining stories I have read in a long time.  I was unable to put this book down from the very beginning.  The author places the reader into 1931 on the train with Kinko, Camel and Jacob.  I highly recommend this book.,overall
A believable rendetion of a time gone by.  Kept me reading late into the night.  Thanks for such a enjoyable read.,overall
I'm not a regular fiction reader, but decided to get this one on my Kindle.  I could hardly put it down once I started.  Author weaves a compelling story involving life in the 30's, animal abuse, circus life, and growing old.  I recommend highly.,overall
I decided to read this book solely based on the fact that it was recommend by Amazon under the \Customers who bought this item also bought\ section on just about every book that I've read this summer. I didn't know what to expect since I hadn't read any reviews about it, so I picked it up, and was not disappointed. I hate looking at other people's reviews before I read a book since they all give away so much of the plot and that irritates me. I like to discover what's going to happen on my own and I detest spoilers. In the end, I'm glad I took Amazon's advice because what I ended up with was a very accessible and entertaining story.I'm not saying this book is perfect by any means. I actually debated over whether to give it 4 or 5 stars, and I ended up going with 5 based almost exclusively on the fact that it was just such a unique and entertaining story. The author, Sara Gruen, colorfully illustrates the world of Depression Era circus life, while weaving in a distinctive coming of age type story, even if it's a little late in life for the main character, Jacob. Coming of age doesn't always have to mean \teenage years\ and in fact can be about any time in a person's life where their life path drastically changes direction. This is absolutely the case for Jacob as he endures a huge devastating crisis that leads him to essentially run away with the circus in his early twenties...something kids across the country and all through the years have dreamed about on particularly hard days when things were just not going quite right for them. However, this particular circus in those particular times did not exactly embody the romantic idea of escaping the harsh reality of the real world, and in fact the result of Jacob's decision landed him in more trouble and heartache than he probably ever thought he'd encounter in his life.I think what I enjoyed most about this particular novel is that I actually learned a lot from it as well as was entertained by it. I don't know about you, but I didn't know too much about circus life in early 1900's America and I always find facts about the Depression and Prohibition life really interesting. Gruen incorporates a lot of circus and era terminology into the prose and even weaves a few true stories into the plot. Most interestingly, she includes amazing real photos of circus life at the beginning of most of the chapters. Between those visual aids and all the beautiful details in the writing, I could really picture everything from the sequined costumes the performers wore to the strangest freaks in the side show attraction to the inhumane treatment the roustabouts and animals had to endure to make the whole thing work. How ironic that they all had to suffer through such a harsh and unforgiving life to bring such a glitzy, fun and care-free show to a different town nearly every night during a horrible time in America's history where people desperately needed that kind of distraction in their harsh and unforgiving lives.I saw on one of the discussion forums about this novel that it has been optioned for a feature film and I am very excited to hear it. I read a lot of books, and I love it when I'm getting into one and I can just start to SEE it in my mind. I start casting it and think about which director would bring the best vision of it to the screen. I really hope that whoever ends up making it does it justice. There's so much potential to bring this to life using an exquisite color and texture palette, and I also hope that the studio doesn't compromise the author's vision of this world by watering it down do appeal to a broader audience. I can just see some ridiculous exec somewhere taking out characters and situations that aren't P.C. so as not to offend Middle America in order to raise ticket sales. That kind of censorship makes me sick and is exactly why so many good novels are turned into crappy movies nowadays.Without giving too much away, I'd just have to recommend this novel to anyone who's looking for an easy \historical fiction\ read with a good, gripping story. There are times when you'll laugh, times when you'll feel uneasy, times you'll be sad and times when you'll be outraged. If you have serious problems with violence against humans and especially animals, you might want to think twice about reading this. Gruen states in the back of the book that she did extensive research to include many accurate portrayals of Depression Era circus life, and that means that often times things weren't pretty behind the scenes. There is also a fair amount of crude language and a few depictions of graphic sexual situations. If this were a film, it would most likely have an R rating for language, sexual situations, alcohol abuse and most especially violence. However, I like my stuff gritty and realistic, so it worked for me.,overall
Vivid descriptions transport you to the front row of the circus.  I loved this book.  Light reading yet colorful in detail.  Everyone I know who has read it loved it.,overall
After reading both of Khaled Hosseini's astonishing books, I worried what next read would hold its own after that. Water for Elephants was an excellent choice - unable to put it down, I read it in two days! Gruen did her research (even tells you about the book's research background at the back), I learned about the circus during the 1930's, and enjoyed a believable, clever, and ultimately triumphant story.,overall
I was hesitant to read this book since it felt like everyone I knew who raved about it was a middle-aged lady and I didn't think it'd have enough action to keep my attention.  To my pleasant surprise, the writing was just brash enough to make me want to keep reading, often laughing out loud at the bizarre pseudo-autobiography.  I recommend it as a quick, easy, summer read.  Yes, a bit on the chick-lit side of the spectrum, but very good just the same.,overall
This was a gift to my 92 year old father for his new Kindle.  He loved it & could relate because it was about an old guy reminissing & so many things were happening that it it kept him very interested. He read it in 2 or 3 days.,overall
The title does not come close in describing the book. I did not expect to be reading a book I could not put down. It was sad yet it was filled with hope. I was cheering the  characters onwhen they met with some negativity in their lives. I could place my self in this book and ride along in the train. I loved then ending, it was better than I thought it would be. Great book, easy read. Thank you,overall
Really a good book.  I had to read it after I had saw the movie.  The movie was good.  The book was even better.,overall
If you prefer to read books that are hard to put down, Water for Elephants us for you!  The love interests, the humane treatment of the elephant and the insider look of what it's like to be part of a circus are very intriguing!,overall
I loved Water For Elephants. I loved how the story was told in flashbacks and dream-sequences. Jacob Jankowski is a nintey-something year old man who has been abandoned by his family in a retirement home. One day Jacob sees a circus come to town through the windows in his retirement home. This circus coming to town forces his aging and forgetting mind to remember a time in his life when he had lost everything and ran away to escape it. He ends up jumping onto a circus train and joining the Benzini Brothers as the circus doctor. On his journey he meets many friends and enemies. The story then alternately goes from present day to depression-era 1930s. While he is working for the circus, the ringleader Uncle Al picks up an elephant from another circus who has just gone broke. I absolutely adore the relationship that forms between Jacob and Rosie (the elephant). Anyone who knows me knows how deeply I care about animals. To see this character stand up and take such responsibility for an elephant in the 1930s was nothing short of heartwarming. This is a book that I recommend. This is a book that I was able to breeze through and I was so sad when I turned to the last page. Speaking of the last page, I adored the ending of this book. It was uplifting and it told me that no matter how old you are, you still have room and time to continue chasing your dreams.Something that I noticed at one point in the book was how parallel Jacob's geriatric life was to Rosie's circus life. There was one quote in particular that I wanted to recall, but it was a library book so I didn't dare mark in it and I returned it prior to writing this. It had something to do with Jacob being friendless, in his nursing-home cage, being poked and prodded. The quote that I selected to open the post with also shows that relationship. This was said to Jacob by Rosemary the nurse. However, this could be also said to the awful August who continually expects Rosie to do the tricks that he wants without giving her any indication whatsoever what those tricks are. I'm sure that with a second reading I could pick up on many other things as well.As I was reading about the book online a lot of people had made comparisons to the HBO series Carivale which I never saw. I'm not sure that I could. I found several of the scenes of animal violence hard to read. One scene in particular still haunts me. In this scene two horses throats are slashed very violently.I am intrigued to see what this time period in the circus did look like which is why I am excited for the movie to be released. I am so excited for Hal Holbrook to be the olde Jacob character and I'm a big fan of Reese Witherspoon however, I do not quite agree with Robert Pattinson being cast as a young Jacob. When I read it I imagined more of a James Franco character. However, perhaps R.Patz can step out of his brooding Eddie the Vampire mode and do an excellent job. We shall see...This review was originally published at bookjackets.wordpress.com,overall
I really enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it. It is an interesting story about life in the circus circuit and its hardships. I found it to be very interesting.,overall
What a wonderfully written book.  The research and details are amazing.  It really leaves you feeling like you've gotten a peek into the life of a traveling circus.,overall
I'm going to be short and sweet about this book. It's wonderful. I couldn't put it down. It's one of the best enjoyable reads I've had in a long while.,overall
I began reading this book and couldn't put it down.  The characters lept from the page as I imagined every scene in technicolor. I will look for other books by this author because she knows how to put pen to paper!,overall
Unusual subject matter enlightened me about a topic I knew nothing about.  The characters sprang to life in an era when the circus travelled by train and the lives of the performers were creative in their means of existance.  Hard and cruel, tender and loving, I fell in love with the characters including the elephants!  A great read.,overall
I absolutely loved this book. I don't often read a book more than once, but I read this one two times!,overall
I loved this book.  I am 59 years old yet - which is a constant surprise to me. I can SO identify with a 93 year old who still is young inside.  This book has definitely made me rethink how we treat the elderly.,overall
This is a great vacation read.  The book is engaging and easy to read.  The author has paralleled the story of Jacob into a depression era love and life story that takes place in a circus.  In Water For Elephants, Jacob steals the love of another man's wife.  The man is cruel and probably mentally ill.  Jacob's heartrending moral dilemma over his love for Marlena amid all the circus characters and their individual tales forms the struggle in the novel. While the novel is character driven, it has plenty of action.  I agree with another reviewer that this book would make a good movie. I gave this 4.5 stars.  It is good not great literature.,overall
Wonderful novel about the circus, circa 1930's.  Gruen is a great storyteller.  Heartfelt, funny, and a real page turner.  Highly recommended.,overall
I really enjoyed this book. One of my all time favorites. After reading it, I became interested in circus/ carnival documentaries. I entertained myself with this subject for about 3 months. True carny people really love the life. Fascinating.,overall
This is such a great story!  Made me want to join Jacob & run away with the circus!  The characters are so real!  I could not put it down, and I would recommend this book to anyone.,overall
I really enjoyed this book. It was a departure from other books I've been reading and I enjoyed it so much. It was interesting to read how circuses were run behind the scenes and how people got involved in them. The story was very compelling and I loved the ending!,overall
My daughter got me to read this book. I wasn't too sure I would like it. But to my surprise once I started it I couldn't put the book down. I was on the plane flying back home and I was reading the book and crying. When I met my husband he said you must have been reading a good book as your eyes are red. And I started telling him what I read and I cried AGAIN. Loved the book.Wanda,overall
This book by Ms. Gruen is truly wonderful literature, not simply a story.  The story is wonderful, but the methods she uses to weave the human existance into it is simply breathtaking.  If you do not like to cry after reading a book, I recommend you avoid it.  The bittersweet human connection in this book is outstanding and she has truly captured circus life in the depression years as no other book has ever done.  A truly wonderful read.,overall
The title of this book attracted me; the cover blurb sounded good; and who can resist an elephant as a character in an adult book?  So even though I was not famliar with the author, I bought this book, and oh how glad I am that I did.  What a magnificent read!  The characters are delightful.  The author's tone and pacing are fantastic as she seamlessly moves you from the present to the past, never leaving you wanting at the end of either time period as she moves her story relentlessly forward.  At the end of this book I had a strange and wonderful reaction.  I actually hugged it to me and just sat there for a minute or so thinking about how good I felt and wondering what the main character might be doing now.,overall
A 90+ gentleman (sharp as a tack) in a nursing home watches from the window as a circus comes to town.  He takes us back in time to his own \carny\ days as a veternarian for the circus animals.  So far sounds boring as heck, doesn't it?  Well, this is one old gent you come to really like.  We learn a lot about the shenanigans behind the scenes of the circus as well as the plight of those during the depression.  Again, sounds boring.  But this author makes it a story you can't put down.  This is a testament to a great writer.  I believe she could make the phone book interesting.  JUST READ IT !!  You won't be disappointed.,overall
I had no interest in reading this suprisingly beautiful book.  The title was weird and I really had no interest in \circuses or elephants\ in general.  I picked it up when I had nothing else handy and couldn't put it down.  The descriptions of Jake's old age slips and deterioration are priceless. They gave me a better understanding of why and how we get cranky as we age.  Priceless!  The authors transition from his old age .. \90 - 93?  Who cares - What's the difference?\ is so descriptive and real .... His passages through his aging and how his family \sets him aside\ and forgets about him; how his friends are long gone; and most important he has lost his soul mate and loving wife after so many years.  He says he has little to contribute to gatherings as no one is interested in his old stories.  It's heart wrenching. This book should be a must read ... not for the circus stories and they are priceless - but for the insight into the art, gift, horror, sadness, delight, and every other emotion of getting old and remembering a life of joy and sadness, love and hate.  The author has a very remarkable talent and Jake is a love.  As for Rosie?  I now love elephants!,overall
Spellbinding novel. I found the story line kept you in suspense as well as wanting to read on and not put the book down.,overall
This is one of those books you'll want to share.  Well written and very interesting as well as entertaining.,overall
A friend loaned me this book and told me it was one of the best she'd ever read.  Then she said, in a voice just above a whisper, \It's about the circus.\.  To be honest, that didn't intrigue me at all.  But right from the start I was hooked and finished the book in two days, then re-read it a couple of days later to my husband.  This is a book I will read over and over again just because of the beauty of the characters and the fascinating facts about the depression-era circus.,overall
I am a nurse.  I love working with the geriatric population.  This story was amazing.  The author hit the nail on the head with the way that elderly are often treated and forgotten, but can have so much to offer.  They are a wealth of knowledge and entertainment.  Very very well written!,overall
FINALLY a book that Amazon recommended that I just LOVED! It was so interesting, wow! I had NO idea what went on behind the scenes at the circus back in the day! I devoured this book within two days because I just had to know how it would end!,overall
When the ending of a book makes me laugh triumphantly and yell, \Yes!\ with tears in my eyes...that's a great story.What a great glimpse into what life must have been like in a time we've begun to forget. Loved it.,overall
When I read the plot of this book, I was skeptical, but I'd heard good things about it, so I gave it a try.  It hooked me and kept me reading immediately.  I loved it. Wonderful story.,overall
I was skeptical at first after reading some of the reviews, especially since this isn't my normal action-adventure, thriller genre. But I took a flyer after a friend said I'd really miss something special if I didn't read Water for Elephants. She was right! Now I'm telling you. Don't miss this wonderful book!,overall
If you enjoyed the HBO Series Carnivale you will love this book.  It is very well researched and captures the feel of the depression. This book provides a lot of historical information while being extremely entertaining.  It also teaches a lesson in how quickly time flies.  It is an adventure, love and mystery story joined together.,overall
I really have no right to proclaim that one day this book will be a classic, but I am going to stick my neck out.  What a powerful read.  This book puts you into circus life in the Depression, shakes you until you are groggy and then wakes you up to find that you can't stop thinking about the story.  Ms. Gruen has obviously done her homework as she draws you into the seedy,muddy, bloody life of the circus.  Very much unlike my experiences, as a child, going to see \THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH,\ circus life is portrayed as something less than  glamorous.  What wonderful characters and the plot is one \big top\ thrill after the other.  I will be very surprised if some Hollywood producer doesn't grab this novel and make a fantastic movie.  A book has to grab me with the first chapter for me to continue and I was grabbed during the first page. Do yourself a favor and give it a shot.  You will not be disappointed at all.,overall
Every so often an author will write a story that seems to have been especially for you. Sara Gruen has written this kind of story. Without question this novel, \Water for Elephants\, is the best book I've read this year and for some time. The events are so real, and the characters so alive they tug at your heart, bring laughter to your lips and tears to your eyes. I absolutely loved it and I'm not an easy guy to please.,overall
I stumbled on this book by accident, it was on an iPad I had borrowed and was checking out the features... but it grabbed my attention from the first page and I could not put it down. I recommended it to friends who loved it just as much. It is not my usual genre, but I loved it. It had everything, tragedy, suspense, romance, and an interesting backdrop for a story. The movie was 'awwright',overall
Loved this book. Though the ending is telegraphed ahead of the final chapter, the book is satisfying and fun.I played in a circus band when I was a teenager and am delighted by the author's accurate feel for circuses and descriptions of circus folks and traditions.Sara Gruen writes well. The story is solid. A very good book.,overall
I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. It isn't often that my 20-year-old daughter and I agree on a book, but this one spanned the generations.,overall
I read this book when it first came out. I picked it up at the library.  I absolutely loved it then they made a movie out of it and the movie was great too (surprise).  I love depression era books and the fact that this took you into the circus during that era was wonderful to me. Sara Gruen makes you feel you are at the circus with these characters and can see them in all their glory and sometimes not so glory.,overall
This book is so detailed and written in such a magnificent way, that it practically puts you in the middle of the Benzini Bros Circus to live the story side by side with Jacob. You feel his love, his anger, his fear, the pain, exhaustion and cruelty of the circus life and the people in it. The twist and turns will leave you breathless and this book is impossible to put down. Recommended 100%.,overall
This book is well written and the story is so compelling! I love how the narrator of the book is the old man. Really helps you to empathize with him and feel what he's feeling. makes me realize that I better live the best life I can right now because some day, I too will be telling my story, if I live to see old age.,overall
Learned alot about the people in the Circus and their struggles.  Have a lot of respect for them now that I read the book.  But the love story was the best.  As always, book so much better than the movie.,overall
I was so surprised at the just how involved I became in this book!  The writing is exquisite, yet transparent.  Some authors have a style that forces you to be aware of how they turn a phrase and /or paint a picture (whether it's done well or not) - \Water for Elephants\  sweeps one away with ease, drawing you into the story, and the lives of the characters, while traversing the books multiple layers.  And Gruen's ability to capture what old age is about is superb.The story's synopsis has already been addressed, so I won't repeat it, but who knew I'd be so involved in this lifestyle?It's been a truly long time since I could not put a book down, and I loved having that experience yet again.,overall
This book flashed between Jacob as an old man and Jacob as a young man just after his parents' death.  Despite his being utterly destroyed by his parents' death, he never really mentioned it again after he joined the circus.  That seemed odd to me.  And the roughness with which he was greeted when he joined would make most ivy league softies run for the hills, so that was odd, too.  I could never understand how he was finding comfort from his parents' death by being treated like crap and working like a dog with barely any water to drink or shower.I enjoyed the elderly Jacob much more, and was charmed by the ending.  I did not enjoy the lengthy descriptions of rolling up circus tents and beating of animals.  I know it happened, but it made me feel ill.  And the sexual descriptions?  I don't like them.  I'm not a prude and I certainly enjoy sex and all its wonders, but I'm sick of reading about it in every single book I touch.  Just once, can't we just leave the details of that out and let a tale stand on its own?I guess the ending made the book worthwhile, but I wouldn't recommend it as much as others have recommended it to me.
Despite haunting cover art and a great title, despite obvious research and well thought out prose, and despite the fact that this book is the darling of the Independent Booksellers Association, I felt let down.  Part of the problem was that I expected a lot and had held this book on my shelf, until I could really savor it.  It does start out strong, and Gruen keeps her time periods well separated.  But the characters, especially the narrator, feel stock and unfinished and merely devices on which to hang the proceeds of research.  Because of the plusses of the book enumerated in the opening sentence of my review, I give 3 stars, but for the back story, it would be fewer.
I loved this story line but because of the few sexual instance, I will not recommend to my friends or my teenage children. It was not necessary to be explicit to be effective. I loved the elderly community and how the novel flashbacks between present day and depression era.  I have grandparents this age and it was true to life in many ways.
In recent years, publishers have put out a number of collections of early twentieth century circus photographs.  The photographs are intensely interesting, revealing the grime, brutality and absurdity underneath the surface glamour of the traveling circuses of that era.Gruen was inspired by the photographs to write this novel.  Gruen thoroughly researched her subject matter, collecting scores of anecdotes that revealed the brutality and desperation of that world.  She weaved the anecdotes together with a love story worthy of a three-hanky weepie from the 1930s. The combination of grit and sweetness works only to a point, but the inherently interesting nature of the subject matter managed to hold my interest to the end.To me, however, Gruen never managed to transcend her source material.  The primary problem was the narrator's voice.  Although the book was sprinkled with circus-specific vocabularly of that era, Gruen utterly fails to capture the rhythm or syntax of the time or milieu. Gruen's language felt inappropriately contemporary, which undermined the overall credibility of the story.  The subject matter cried out for a writer with an ear for the street; I kept thinking about what Damon Runyon or Ring Lardner could have done with this material.The other major problem was that Gruen over-anthropomophized and over-romanticized the animals in the story.  Gruen could have honored the animals' intelligence -- and decried the brutality of their treatment -- without veering into fantasy.In the end, while I wasn't sorry I read the book, I would have preferred to read a non-fiction account of life in the Depression-era circus from a first hand source rather than this watered down trifle.
I was excited to read this book because so many people loved it. I wanted to love it, I really did, but something just fell flat. The story was good, although I found the flashing back and forth distracting, and Sara Gruen obviously did copious amounts of research, but I just couldn't get excited about it.The character of Marlena could have been a really interesting and multi-layered person, but instead she is really only presented as a delicate flower who loves animals, married a psychopath, and sometimes displays teenage acts of defiance. Why did Jacob love her so much? There must have been more to her than that, but the reader is never let in on that secret. It's even more odd because the author is a woman. They had strong female personalities in the 1930s, I'm sure of it.As for Jacob, I thought that he displayed a lot of the conflict and inner questioning that you like to see in a lead character and his development as he gets to know the people that work for the circus was enjoyable. His relationship with the animals was obviously meant to heal him after the death of his parents, but again, I felt like that connection was rushed and then brushed aside. His relationship with Rosie, the gentle and abused Polish speaking (well, Polish understanding) elephant, was an excellent metaphor for his own gentle nature and his inability to stand up for himself and break free. Of course, in the end, everyone is free thanks to Rosie and we get the happy ending.I did not hate the book at all, but I wanted more from it. I think if the author had been allowed to write about 100 pages more, it could have been a great novel instead of just ok. The descriptions of the 1930s era circus and the care she took in researching every detail made the book very interesting. It's certainly worth a read.
I was compelled to finish the book and found the circus hx interesting.The story itself felt very Nicholas Sparks-like.So if you like his work, I think you'd like this book. The protagonist character didn't seem real...he was too good, too kind, too selfless. There were no real surprises about how the plot would unfold. But I'm glad I read it and it was a good escape.
I had heard so much talk about this book but I wasn't that impressed or intrigued. It gave me a glimpse into how hard a life the circus folks had and gave me the feeling it was the place you ended up when you had no place else to go. Definitely took the glamour out of my fascination with circus'. I am glad I read it, it wasn't a waste of time but it just wasn't as good as I expected.
I was rather disappointed with the way some of the sordid details took away from an otherwise interesting story line.  I really liked the \backstage\ peeks into the real life of what being on the road (or on the rails) could be like. And the general story line was very interesting. Not totally my cup of tea, but perchance my high expectations going in didn't help. Keep your expectations a bit lower & it may even be more enjoyable for you!!!
Maybe it was all the hype around this book when I read it, with the movie just coming out, but I was expecting it to be better.  It was a decent book and I don't regret reading it, but it was missing something for me.  I didn't really like the ending either.
This book was fun.  The old circus is always fascinating and fun.I read the book very quickly, which is unusual for me.  If you like fun easy books, then this is a good one for you.But this book is not literature, and will be forgotten soon, and won't be read in 10 years.  It does not compare with Amy Tan, who has written literature that will probably continue to be read for a hundred years.
I'm torn on my opinion about this book which I just finished last night.  I loved the parts where Jacob was old; it successfully portrayed the anguish and confusion anyone would feel when their independence, privacy, and basically their rights are taken away from them. I really felt it.  The story grabbed me right away and continued to be enjoyable and interesting through about half the book; then it deteriorated a bit after that.  All in all though I enjoyed the book and the characters and am not sorry I read it.  Definitely easy reading.Laura
A pleasant, quick read.  The circus details were nicely researched and its full of colorful characters.  I did, however, find the alternating time periods intrusive, and the plot sadly predictable.  I also wish the villain had been more complex -- although the author provides us with mental illness as an excuse, it seemed too convenient, and frankly, not quite clinically credible. A sweet ending, although perhaps a bit sentimental. All in all, not an original book, nor one that will stand the test of time, in my opinion, however, for all that, an agreeable way to spend the afternoon.
I have never been a fan of the circus, but I do enjoy historical fiction, so I gave this one a try. I was skeptical at best when starting. The story is mildly interesting, entertaining,and entirely predictable. The characters were shallow, not well developed, but the story moves along quickly enough so this is not a big distraction. An earlier reveiwer summarized the book as \melodramatic\ and I completely agree. It is like popcorn; light, fluffly, easy to digest and quickly forgotten. Not a bad way to spend a rainy weekend -- if there is nothiing on TV.
WE was terrific out of the starting blocks, vivid and well-researched, replete with interesting characters.  Along the way, though, it increasingly took on the feel of a creative writing exercise -- ever lighter on research, weaker on character development, and thinner on plot.  In the end, I found WE disappointing.  Like many historical novels by contemporary young authors, WE is only shallowly situated in its particular historical context (depression era, circus).  Every now and then the author tosses in a cliched reference to food lines to remind the reader of the historical moment; otherwise, nothing to suggest the landscape (literal and figurative) through which the Benzini Brothers train chugs ever onwards.  I emerged from WE with far less of a feel for circuses or society in the 1930s, or for aging and the elderly today, than I should have.  WE reads like an entertaining short story stretched to the breaking point.  There just isn't enough 'there' there...
after a visit to the ringling circus in sarasota,i realized what a good book this is.ican appreciate the fine hardworking performing community.this is a must read for circus lovers.
The historical story was interesting and kept my attention, even though I think TOO MANY people here are giving Ms. Gruen too much credit.  Personally, I don't think she used enough historical fact and instead relied on a very formulaic plot-line that was very predictable, i.e. the love relationship, the MC and head of the animals will be foiled in the end, and the preposterous ending where our dear wonderful elephant kills the cruel animal director.  Too contrived for me.I can understand the popularity of this book.  I cannot understand why it's a runaway bestseller.
Nice enjoyable reading.  A very nostalgic look at what circus life must have been during those times.  A very fun book!
If it doesn't depress you reading about getting old and senile and cruelty to animals, this is the book for you! Yes, it is very, very well written which is why I couldn't stop reading it, but it is very, very depressing.
I bought this book when it was a Kindle deal of the day, although I had long had it on my wish list due to the many rave reviews it had received.  I have never been fascinated by circuses, so maybe that's why I didn't find this story to be very engaging.  The characters never seemed very real, and the story just seemed too implausible for my taste.  I did enjoy the device of having the protagonist tell the story from his point of view at age 90 and at 23, and I thought the chapters taking the 90 year old's viewpoint were far better written than the rest of the book.  While I didn't dislike the book, I certainly do not think it deserves the high praise bestowed upon it by the majority of the reviewers.
The circus part of this novel is great and beautifully written and I really enjoyed it. Two things bothered me however; he really didn't do anything veterinariany after the initial diagnosing of the horse and the romance between Jacob and Marlena wasn't well evolved.overall it was good bathtub reading and it made me more interested in the circus.
I heard they made a movie of this so I bought the book but was disappointed in it.  Maybe it was just me.  Never did like circus.
I am not sure what I see all the hype about for this book but it was a pageturner, I'll give it that. The writing was very well done as Jacob told his tale of being in the circus all these years later in a nursing home, forgotten and old in body, not in mind.The life of the circus was clearly visible while reading this story as was the life in a nursing home. At first I was more interested to have the chapters go back to the present because the past was so horrible to witness but then his present life wasn't that cozy either.The ending was the best part of the book, for me, as it was most tender. It wasn't a bad read but not an entertaining one.
I think really I would give this three and a half stars but because we can't do that I've gone with three. This book was really well written and in turn I was able to picture the characters as clearly as if they were people in the flesh. One particular character August got on my nerves and made me so mad I can't describe but that shows what great writing it was. Good book about how life is travelling with a circus.
Overall, I'm rather underwhelmed based on the hype around this book.The details of the Great Depression were amazing, and seemed accurate enough.  The writing didn't get in the way too much but seemed amateurish at times.  I spent the ENTIRE afternoon, EACH and EVERY ONE was used three times in a single chapter, and unimaginative clich&eacute;s one after another such as quick as lightning were not uncommon.  I assumed this was Gruen's first novel and was quite surprised to find out it was her third.The morality of the story fell very flat as well.  The characters kind of want to do the right thing, but I wasn't sold on their move toward adultery based on initial attraction.  A lot of people feel an attraction toward someone who is not their spouse.  That doesn't mean it is right or destined.  Greun's inability to convince me that Jacob and Marlena were any different was a major failing of the novel for me.How many meals can people in the Great Depression skip without even thinking about it.  At least a dozen times through the book people skipped meals because they didn't feel like eating.I had high expectations so I'm judging harshly.  Did not meet expectations.  Not a bad book by any means, but far short of novel-of-the-year quality.
This book is just a fun read. Nothing deep or realistic about the story. Nothing to be learned. No point. Just entertainment. Don't expect to connect with any of the characters because they are totally unrealistic. This book is just pure fantasy, almost childish. I did find the book worth reading, not a waste of time because it is entertaining. However, am I compelled to buy another book from this author? Probably not. Am I going to recommend it to my friends? Probably so with the disclaimer that it is a light fun read.
I liked the ending of this book better than any other part. This mans life after the death of his parents was hard, as expected. It dragged on for me, until the end when he was living his last years of his life in a nursing home. his children disregarded him emotionally. They went to visit, but real interest in him was gone. They did their duty. He escapes in the end and lives out his life with the circus. The place where he lived most of his life after his parents death.It was good, not great for me.
i didn't think that iwould like this book, but found that once i became involved with the time period and the characters i did like the book.  it was a book club selection from one of my three books clubs, otherwise iwould not have chosen it.  but after reading did like it.  because of the circus performers handicaps, it may not be appropriate for all readers but the story is so strong that the reader soon forgets the less desirable features of the story.
This is a 300 page book which took about 200 pages to grab me. It felt like the first 2/3 of this book just created background, letting us know the various characters in the circus and giving us a sense of life in that traveling circus of the 1930s. All of this was well written and interesting, but there was not much of a story until the final 100 pages, or at least it never grabbed me until then. I didn't start to really care about the narrator until then. Those final 100 pages were great fun, and I loved the ending of this book. I recommend this book, but cannot quite give it four stars when I spent most of the book waiting for things to pick up. If you read this, just sit back and enjoy the good portrait of circus life in the depression. Don't be impatient, like me. Eventually, this picks up steam and delivers so well. The ending is one of the best I have read in so long.
Gruen's novel is the story of one man's life.  It is presented both as a recollection of a 93 year old man reflecting on his youth, as well as the current story of the matured man.  The central story revolves around a character that drops out of school after a family tragedy.  Being the depression and few work opportunities available, the character finds himself working with a circus.  The author clearly researched the subject and provides historical photos to provide the reader assistance with the visualization.  Overall, the book was enjoyable up until the last chapter.  I feel like I would have been much happier if the author left this chapter off all together as it in implausible and affected my entire view of the book.
Did I only read this because it is supposed to have been a NaNoWriMo book? Yes. Does Sara Gruen mention that \fact\ ANYWHERE in the book acknowledgments, on her website or in interviews? No. (Although she doesn't contradict the claim, which has been made very publicly by one of NaNoWriMo's founders.) Was it still worth the read? Meh. I don't know. I guess. Whatever. It wasn't a waste of time to read it, but it didn't enrich me or leave me with any lingering thoughts or feelings about the book. As a matter of fact, I barely remember what it was about (I want to say circuses?). All in all, it was a zero balance book. Some good footnotes though. I'd definitely recommend those.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.
OK, it's not fine literature (so critics, would you please lighten up?), but it was lots of fun -- a glimpse into the era and life of the circus.  I honestly couldn't put it down and felt good when it ended.  Will this be on my list of all-time favorites?  No, but I appreciated the author's research into the topic; I learned something and enjoyed myself. What more could I want from a beach read?
Life in the circus during the Depression is probably depicted very accurately; times were hard and people were desperate.  The circus setting for the book is excellent; but, in my opinion, the plot is somewhat weak and the ending was less than I had hoped for.As others have described the scenes vary from life in a nursing home to Jacob's past life in the circus.  I actually liked that juxtapostion and felt it was done well.  I loved the pictures in the book and felt they added a lot.  In short, not a bad read, just not as gripping as I had hoped it would be.
Not very exciting but a decent read.
I really enjoyed the juxtaposition between the 90 (or was it 93?)-year-old Jacob and the young man Jacob who ran away to join the circus in 1931. However, towards the end, the 1931 story devolves into a bit of a soap opera the I didn't really enjoy. Other than that I found it a lively read...but I wanted more about Rosie, the Polish-understanding elephant who everyone thinks is dumb because she doesn't understand English. Every moment where she is on the page, the book is highly entertaining, but I found parts of the book slow-moving and lackluster when the story so lends its self to being bouncy and light (it is about a circus, Miss Gruen!). People \locked eyes\ 10 too many times for me. I loved the parts when Jacob is 90~~or is it 93~~(he can't remember)and his body, his family and life, in general has betrayed him. If you are looking for some lightweight entertainment and a quick read, I would recommend this book. The biggest thing that bugged me about this edition (and many other books) are the book club discussion questions at the end of the book. These type of questions are too lengthy to actually be part of a lively book discussion (believe me, I know...whenever someone in my book group chooses to go this route, the discussion dies a hideous death). These questions are better suited for essay questions.
Water for Elephants is a small step up from chick-lit, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, if it's what you're looking for.  A great read for the beach, or a good light read in-bewteen heavier or darker novels.As mentioned in other reviews, the character development was on the poor side, and the plot was pretty predictable (kind of hokey).  I felt the reading level was quite low, which made it a quick read, but not the brightest one.  Everything was pretty spoon-fed to the reader...there was no need for me to think about anything.  I prefer a bit more of a challenge.
Sure it is a well researched book.  The detail and description of circus life is very realistic and at times downright disgusting.  But what else does this book have that made one of my friends rave that this was the best book she had every read.  I'll tell you what....nothing.  I partly read this book on the recommendation of friend but I also wanted to read it because it was described as a murder mystery book.  A mystery murder it is not and by the end of this book I wanted all of the main characters to go away too!  I won't spill any beans but frankly this book deserved less time on the best seller's list and more time on the bottom of my discard pile (the books I will never read again or books that I would like to forget).  You make up your mind.
Let me say at the outset of this review that I usually read literary fiction.  This book was a departure for me, one that I took on the faith of the 1600+ positive reviews.  Those reviews misled me, I'm afraid.It's mystifying why so many reviewers loved this book.  It's not a bad story, a fairly straightforward narrative without any literary flourishes, written in plain language and present tense. Certainly the author did her research so she could use the right lingo and details.  Flash-forwards to the protagonist's current life in a nursing home only provide a pretense for the ending, unfortunately.  The plot is so thin that until about 3/4ths of the way through, I was convinced there wasn't one.  Likewise, the characters are fairly thinly realized, except for the \paranoid schizophrenic\ villain and the intelligent elephant, Rosie.  I found myself wondering why I even liked the protagonist, who fashioned himself as a kind of savior for a couple of victimized lesser players.  Recently bereaved, the protagonist's experience of bereavement is completely absent from the book, which I found unrealistic at best.That said, I was surprised that I stuck it out and read to the end, which is why I didn't give the book a lower rating.  In all honesty, the last quarter of the book is quite possibly the best, when the main character finally acts on all his misguided desires. However, the final scene disappointed me; it seemed a bit too contrived.Light reading, this one.  If you want to read for 30 minutes before bed, this is a good bet, because it doesn't not require much thought or deconstruction.
The quality of the writing is not in question. My problem is that I did not find the characters or plot to be engaging. I did not enjoy the book and have no interest in seeing the movie.
This is a well researched and reasonably well written book,in the sense I began to care what happens to the main characters. There are serious weaknesses, though, which are very irritating. Compared to all the prattle about his falling in love at first sight with a woman, there's not much in this book about this veterinarian's love for animals. He just has a dim realization that he's got to take care of them because in the midst of all the cruelty, he's all they've got. The end of this vets years in the circus are compressed too much, so the book switches from very great detail of his life as a young man, all of a sudden, to his life as an ancient in a nursing home!I am an animal lover, and felt cheated that this circus based book was just another love story, and all about the people. There are some remarkable strenghts, too..Ms. Gruen's description of the elderly in assisted living is brilliant and moving. Though I enjoyed the book, it's not a keeper and I will be passing it on to a friend without any reluctance to give the book away. M
I was torn between two or three stars. I read this book for my book club, otherwise it is unlikely I would have picked it up considering my backlog.Personally I didn't find anything wow-ish or over the top astounding with this story. Besides that it takes place in a circus. It had its moments of course, which makes me think that what really makes you like a book is not sometimes the overall story, but a couple of scenes that really stand out. And this had a handful of those, especially those set in the present time, which were the only ones to actually pull my emotional strings, which usually doesn't take much I'm afraid, and considering that this book didn't stir much in me overall. Not even the traditional `big twist' scene riled me up. I actually read a paragraph past it then did a double take on `oh that was suppose to be it'.
It was good, much better than the movie.  It held my attention and provided much of  a circus background. It was interesting.
The story was good but had too many swear words for my taste. The circus storyline was very interesting (ie, how a circus works, what happens behind the scenes, etc). I was also surprised to find a good description of getting old. If you're interested in reading just that part of the book, skip the chapters with pictures at the beginning. In doing so, you'll also skip most of the foul language.I've given this book 3 stars, but it really should be 2 and a half.
WATER FOR ELEPHANTS gives the reader an insight to the innards of the early circuses,  It is well written.  I preferred the movie.
Normally I wouldn't have picked this up. The circus is not really a topic that interests me, and cruelty to animals really upsets me. My coworker really liked this one and talked me into reading it.I tried to get into it, I really did, but this book draaagged for me and I'm not exactly sure why. Honestly I had a very hard time finishing it, and I'm usually a very quick reader.It seemed to have all the makings for a good story (A decent beginning, middle and end...love story...drama...etc etc.) Obviously there are a lot of people out there that really enjoy it. I'm glad it worked for some people. I wish I had found it as compelling as everyone else, but for whatever reason I just could *not* connect with the characters emotionally. The forbidden love story left me feeling bored, and I didn't feel all that sympathetic towards the lovers. The only character that really was interesting to me was August, the cruel/charming/abusive husband. He was definitely the highlight of the book for me.Overall, I guess I wil give it a 3. It was okay, not poorly written, and I could see it being a 5 star for some people...just not me.
The story of this plot-driven book keeps you turning the pages, but I did not much care for the characters. They didn't have much depth; they could have been developed so much more. In addition, there are quite a few scenes that are either offensive or gross or both, apparently for sheer sensationalism. The circus train theme is interesting and fun to read, and this is what keeps the book going. One scene near the end depicted the main characters in a church; I thought this would be developed further. It turns out this was just added in to try to show the morality of Jacob, perhaps to foreshadow that he could never kill Marlena's husband August. Jacob started out at the beginning of the book as a naive innocent kid. How he could change into such an experienced risk-taker in a period of just a few months confused me. He certainly doesn't seem the church-going type by the end of the novel. And the fact that he and Marlena end up together, with lots of animals, by way of Rosie eliminating August, is just plain silly.
As I read this book, I found that it was continuously straight-forward. There weren't any twists really, any shockers, and nothing that wasn't really expected. The \shocking\ ending was more of just an \hmm, all right.\ It didn't really change anything nor did it affect how I felt towards any of the characters.The story is a good one that did keep me reading and interested. It shifted between the past and present day as the protagonist continued to reminisce about previous years and reflected on his current life. I did not really get connected to any of the characters and I just felt like there was something missing from this book that I just couldn't put my finger on.The characters were interesting, the story was good, and the setting was of course new and refreshing. But it just seemed something was lacking. As I was reading the \Reader's Questions\ in the back contemporary books are starting to put in, I found that they weren't many powerful themes or internalizations to take away from this book. That doesn't mean the book was bad because it was just a straight-forward story, it just was missing something.All the parts woven together make an all right read, but nothing amazing or enlightening.
This book tells of a man whose experiences as a young man are recalled when he's in his 90's. the writing is vivid and the experiences of the man when he's young and old are effectively told. My imagination was captured and I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
It was an OK book. I was expecting it to be really great and it didn't really live up to the hype. Maybe the movie is better
There are some brilliant scenes in this book. Gruen does a great job capturing the era and the characters who led the circus life. I re-read the last chapter a few times and think she had a few too many martinis and left out some key info that would have made the ending tighter.I do want to see the movie despite mixed reviews.
I bought this book because it was a Kindle Daily Deal and I'm glad I didn't spend more than $1.99 on it. It was an interesting read, but it did seem very contrived in a lot of places. I know nothing about circuses or being a vet, but even so, the book seemed to pick up only on meaty half-realities, kind of like she wanted to shock or surprise or otherwise manipulate the reader. I didn't like the present day parts...why was that necessary? Kind of like an easy way to let us know that the main character (POSSIBLER SPOILER, BUT ONLY IF YOU DON'T READ THE FIRST CHAPTER) survived and did okay.I think, in short, it was a very melodramatic book. Evil, moustache-twirling villian(s) (did he HAVE to be Jewish? Really?) Sweet, beautiful heroine. Smart, masculine hero. Lots of supporting characters. That said, the hero had a lot of failings. I should have liked that (deviating from the melodrama), but his failings seemed nonsensical. Why did he stand by so many times when animals were being harmed?I didn't hate the book. I read it and enjoyed it, more or less, but it didn't seem like any kind of great literature. I'm surprised it was made into a movie, in some ways. In others, it seems just right as the characters seemed to have been written with the big screen in mind.
It's OK.  It's long and not really eventful until the end.  It took me a bit to get into it
I found this book to be an engaging and interesting read.  There were several authenticity and continuity issues that bothered me.  During the era of this situation, Fox Terriers were very common and used a great deal in entertainment.  Jack Russel terriers are a relatively recent introduction to the US.Jacob gives his watch away, and then it reappears.  There are two or 3 other gaffs along this line that are annoying.  It would be great if the author would put out a new edition with these things corrected.Rose, the elephant is the real heroine of this novel, and she provides the frame for the story.
It's tough to be the sour note in a chorus of \Hallelujahs.\  \Water for Elephants\ disappointed me. I believed and liked the narrator, Jacob, a snarky old coot who apparently couldn't stop complaining. I wanted to like this story. But I couldn't.The characters who accompanied Jacob on his journey were so strange and unbelievable that empathy was unachievable for me. To see them as anything but gargoylesque charicatures was impossible. Perhaps if they hadn't been circus characters, but everyday kinds of people like grocers and real estate agents they would have been more believable.  Perhaps if they had not been so extreme in their outlooks, histories and passions they would have seemed real. But we shall never know.As it stands, the book is beautifully written, with all the skill of language and prose that one could desire.  It has an important theme and is chock full of human frailty, and human victory.  It even has elephant victory! But it has a singular deadly flaw that scars the book so much for me that I can not enjoy it or recommend it.I AM glad to be in the minority with regard to this book.  I AM glad for all those who are not bothered by the characters. May you read on in happiness.
I appreciated the back and forth of the book, 93 year old Jacob, and then back to 23 year old Jacob.  I must admit that I appreciated the old man's story in the nursing home more than the kid on the train, but that's just me.  The one thing I noticed right off the bat is that this writer took very seriously - \don't tell, show\ and show she does in sometimes tedious plodding, even disgusting detail.This can actually become tiresome.I was surprised because my favorite author is a \show-er\, and I love to read her work, but maybe it's the fact that she has never written something as long as this.In anycase, I have not gone through the thousands of reviews there are, but there are over 1500 5 star reviews, and I can't help but wonder - if the protagonist was a woman, and what happened to Jacob that night he drank entriely too much had happened to her - would it not be considered a rape or sexual assault of some kind?  Has the definition changed since I was younger?  I just have a big feeling that if it was a woman who was drunk out of her mind and two overly friendly men thought they would *welcome* her to the circus at that very time in her state of no mind - it would be all hell and high water in here - not 1500 five star reviews.  I dont understand why it's different.  Is that why if a man is raped, he would rather suffer in shame than speak up?  Does he wonder who will take him serously?  Who will care?You know what else gets me?  When you take away the wordiness of this book, the premise, plot and story of young Jacob is so painfully simple it's not even funny, there is NO development of the relationship between he and Marlena.  *Spoiler Alert*  It all boils down to boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, girl gets beat up by her abusive husband, boy hates husband, husband gets miraculously killed - boy runs away with girl they have tons of kids and live happily ever after.  The story of the circus was quite honestly just alright I dont understand the utter praise for this book. Is it because we are shown the innerworkings of a long ago circus, is it because its ending seemed shocking?  Is it because four of the characters we get to know are sacrificed in the closing chapters?  I have no idea - something has happened in our society where things that are just \ok\ are slapped with excellent and pushed ahead with \mind blowing\.  The same thing happened with \The Help\  - I actually saw someone refer to that one as a \classic\ - seriously?  You compare this to Frankenstein and Pride and Prejudice and Portrait of the Artist - really?If It weren't for 93 year old Jacob's nursing home story, I would not have given this book 3 stars.  I'd be down there hated with the ones and twos.Proudly hated with the ones and twos.
I got this book because it had such good reviews and it was recommended in my school library.  I liked it but I wasn't grabbed by it.  It's not horrible at all but just not my favorite.
I thought the setting and milieu were much more interesting than the characters and their development. The background was interesting but the characters were not. They lacked depth and seemed cast as types rather than developed as characters who are realistic in their setting.
A nice, simple story.  Entertaining, but not great literature.  Good circus anecdotes.  Reasonably well researched, but I noticed a few inaccuracies.  Overall, I was glad I read it.
So I read this book WELL before the movie came out. I was intrigued by a story that had a backdrop in a circus.But I was left really disappointed. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I just didn't connect with the story at all. It may have just been the timing was wrong for me to read this story, but I was not into it (and I find myself rarely disappointed with books). I think there wasn't enough magic in it for me. I didn't see the basis for the romance. Maybe I need to try to pick it up again, but I was left so disappointed that I really don't want to.
This novel flows smoothly. It is a linear type of story line, once one gets into the past. What I did not like about this novel is that the author is a female, while the protagonist is a male. One of the things we studied in literature was that a female author cannot truly portray a male character. And in this case I agree. Jacob is more girl/boy than man. He is cowered by Marlena's husband all the time. He is unadventurous when it comes to sexual escapades; he is just too shy, too immature to appeal to me. Also, the love story was not developed well at all. There is no palpable attraction. Marlena is created into the damsel in distress, stuck with an abusive husband, and Jacob is thrown in to rescue her. I think this damsel in distress aspect has been over done. However, it may have worked had the author actually spent a bit more time on developing the h and h's attraction, relationship.However, I did enjoy all the author's research. She did a good job transporting me on that circus train, living the way those people probably did.
I have to admit I enjoyed this book - the settings were very interesting, and the main character, Jacob, was very likable.However, I was incredibly disappointed by the love story that takes center stage. If you're looking for a book with  a female lead you can root for, this is DEFINITELY not it. Marlena is the main star of the equestrian act and loves horses and for that - and that alone - you are supposed to love her.The two of them - Jacob and Marlena - bond over their shared passion for animals (he's the circus vet) and hiding from her crazy husband, but there is no real spark between them to latch onto as a reader, and their whole relationship leaves something to be desired. Actual chemistry, maybe?In addition to that, the storyline is often incredibly contrived, to a point where by the end I couldn't bring myself to buy into any of it anymore.An amusing read, just the same, but I didn't find it to be all it was cracked up to be.
I bought this book out of curiousity and the big hoopla over what a \sleeper hit\ this story had become,I love animals,so I gave it a try.One of the other Amazon customer reviewers said that the main character was talking to a reporter. No, he's not talking to anyone, just us, but I was bothered HOW he was communicating to us.Since everyone else has synopsized the plot ad nauseum. I'll just report the weaknesses in this book.First of all, very little elephant!!! Not Water For Elephant(s), but Water for ELEPHANT, ONE elephant. And very little elephant. Whatever research she did on these animals was tiny, miniscule. I could have gotten more into the mind of pachyderms by watching a Nat.Geo or Animal Planet special.As for his being a veterninarian. I too own horses, been around them and vets for nearly 5 decades. What little circus animal veterinary work Ms. Gruen describes in the book she probably got watching a cable TV station animal special.I also concur with the veterinarian reviewer on the slaughter of the horses. If a horse is forced to watch the other beside it die violently, most likely when it smells all that blood, you can bet the ranch it would break its' halter or rope and be nine miles gone.I also found it very distracting the numerous referrals to minute body languages while the characters talked. Also, even though the story started pretty promising, once Jacob got established as an employee in the circus, it bottomed out into nothing but petty bickerings and jealousies among all the circus employees. Yawn....It was fast reading, but I started hoping the thing would end soon. And, yeah, the animal stampede at the end I wasn't buying. I think Ms. Gruen could have just watched Nat. Geo or Animal Planet replays of elephants gone bonkers on video in circuses and let Rosie the elephant just get even by squishing those who had abused her.
I liked this book a lot.  And there were parts where I couldn't wait to find out what happened.  The book went back and forth between the 1930's and present time.  And I couldn't wait, sometimes, to see what the next part was.Then, I went to a book club and the people fawned over the book -- especially the incredible research, the way the employees and animals were treated and the shocking ending.  Well, that made me like the book less.  I don't care how wonderful the research is, if it's not written well.  And a lot of the things that the author wanted you to feel sympathy for, I just didn't.  I'm sorry that Camel got Jamaica giner paralysis, but he was a horrible alcoholic and addict who would drink anything to get a buzz.  Something was bound to happen.  And the way the employees and animals were treated -- was that really a shock to anyone?  Did people not know that?  Animals were always abused and it was the depression -- not paying someone and throwing them off a train is not unexpected.  And the \shocking\ ending.  Gee whiz -- a 4 year old could see that coming.  ***SPOILER NEXT*** From the moment the author mentioned that the circus was in town and that Jacob's people always came on Sundays, I knew they woulnd't show up.  ***SPOILER ENDS***.So, I liked the book, I liked the story.  I didn't like people all ga ga over facts that should be common sense.  This book should be read as a work of fiction (as it is) and just enjoy it for that.
I think that it was very slow to start and had a lot of places that the story line crept to the point that I wanted to put the book down.  The last 1/3 of the book was excellent.  I would have liked to seen the first two thirds of the book to have been faster moving.
With its spotlight on elephants, Gruen's romantic page-turner hinges on the human-animal bonds that drove her debut and its sequel (Riding Lessons and Flying Changes)--but without the mass appeal that horses hold. The novel, told in flashback by nonagenarian Jacob Jankowski, recounts the wild and wonderful period he spent with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a traveling circus he joined during the Great Depression. When 23-year-old Jankowski learns that his parents have been killed in a car crash, leaving him penniless, he drops out of Cornell veterinary school and parlays his expertise with animals into a job with the circus, where he cares for a menagerie of exotic creatures[...] He also falls in love with Marlena, one of the show's star performers--a romance complicated by Marlena's husband, the unbalanced, sadistic circus boss who beats both his wife and the animals Jankowski cares for. Despite her often clich&eacute;d prose and the predictability of the story's ending, Gruen skillfully humanizes the midgets, drunks, rubes and freaks who populate her book.
I had heard a lot about this book and was excited to read it. It may have suffered from too much anticipation but I wasn't enthralled. I thought it was okay. I found it patched together and in need of a little relief. From old age home to parent's dying to hardships of circus life, I just felt weighed down.
It was a pretty good book, but  I had no idea there would  be so much foul language and  sexual material in it. I was pretty disappointed in that.
I enjoyed this book, but did not find it to be the \home run\ I expected or was led to believe it would be. The most moving, authentic passages were delivered by 93-year-old Jacob Jankowski. You just gotta love this elderly gent. The chapters in his voice gave me a new understanding of what it means to be old and alone; the fact that Gruen could craft such a believable male character, to my way of thinking anyhow, redeems many of this book's other flaws.I read numerous positive and negative reviews on amazon, and I agree with several other reviewers that Jacob can sometimes be a bit frustrating, in that he fails to take appropriate action when it seems most called for, and at other times gets all up-in-arms and confrontational over far lesser infractions. But to me, this makes him a human and believable character. Haven't we all \lamed out\ when we should have taken action, or overreacted when we shouldn't have? What I hate even more is when a character is always ready, willing and able to jump through impossible hoops to save the day. If I only wanted that in my literary characters, I'd stick to James Bond novels. I do, however, agree with many other reviewers who pointed out that some dialogue is a bit too pat and unbelievable for both the era and the circumstances in which this story is supposed to have taken place.But what I simply do not get is why so many readers are up in arms about the so-called graphic sex scenes. They were neither numerous nor particularly offensive, but I guess sensibilities are wide-ranging where sex is concerned. I suppose the sideshow scene with Barbara and her magnificent boobs could be characterized as somewhat sexist, but so what? It was provocative and engaging. And while that scene and Jacob's \initiation\ could be labeled both gratuitous and graphic,  I would argue that any graphic sex scene is gratuitous. Writers always have the option of \panning to the flickering candle\ rather than telling us what the heck is happening. I give an author points for taking the risk of telling me. Besides which, I'd consider the absence of raunchy performances and sexual hanky-panky in a book about a traveling circus to be an inauthentic, gaping omission. So while I could have taken or left these two particular scenes, I believe they were well written and have their place in this story.All of that said, my biggest complaints about this book are Marlena's shallowness, and the mounting melodrama as the story nears its (preposterous) ending. Though Marlena is perhaps the second most important character in this novel, I found her to be vapid, insipid and uninspiring. I thought Rosemary (the assisted-living home nurse) was far more endearing and believable, for as minor a character as she was. True, the villains (Uncle Al, August) were likewise a bit \canned,\ but I can forgive a lack of character development for certain secondary characters because, after all, an author has but so many pages in which to tell her story. But Marlena, as the circus's star performer and Jacob's love interest, should have been better developed.  And I suppose I simply must accept the ending for what it is--something of an outrageous letdown.Despite these shortcomings, I enjoyed Water for Elephants. It drew me in enough to hold my interest, and it certainly has its strong points. For example, I thought the author did a fabulous job bringing the animal characters to life as sentient, unique beings. I loved the aged Jacob, and liked his young counterpart only slightly less. I will admit, I expect more from (and am therefore harder on) traditionally-published books than self-published ones so I gave Water for Elephants three stars rather than four. If a writer is lucky enough to get published, then I hold him or her to a higher standard than schlubs like myself who try to put a good, thought-provoking product before the public without the benefit of editors, professional cover designers or national distribution networks. More power to Sara Gruen for being among the fortunate few to land a publishing deal.
It got slow in the middle.  The ending made the book worth reading.  It was very sad to read how animals are treated by circus handlers.
This book was a very easy read I will say that. It was very accurate with the  time frame an  all the  language used. Other than that the story wasn't very captivating. There was no twists or anything really interesting. I wonder if the movie is actually better than the book.
It was just not what I thought it would be. I'm sure it's a good book, just not for me.
This was an interesting one for me.  I've had this book on my \to read\ shelf at home for over a year and never picked it up until now.  I have no idea why.  I was excited when I bought it and then never did anything about it.  Now the movie is coming out and I wanted to read the book first.The old man telling the story really pulled me in and came to life for me.  I really felt for him!  And laughed at him because he is quite funny.  He is flashing back to his youth when he joined the circus and fell in love.The author has amazing talent.  She really paints a vivid picture.  Unfortunately, too well at times.  There were some really nasty, crude scenes that set the tone for the book and the train life and the depression, but they were way too much for me.  Very disturbing. If you don't like books with sex scenes, then avoid this one!  They paint a picture that you would rather not have in your head.Once you get past all that crude stuff, then the book comes alive.  You get sucked into the life of this cute elephant and of the love story between Marlena and Jacob.  Unforgettable, that is for sure.  Moved me almost to tears at a few points with the elephant.Because of the crude stuff I would have to rate this just 3 out of 5 *'s.  If some of that would have been cut out, then it easily would have made 5*'s.  I hope some of it is cut out of the movie!
This book was well written but I have to admit I had difficulty getting through some of the elephant torture passages, in fact I am still cringing thinking of them, (not that some humans didn't face some awful abuse as well in this book)...
This book is so-so though it seems to be very well researched in terms of both circus lore and the depression.  I can understand anyone with a passion for the circus or the 1930's getting excited about it but for the average reader it has nothing special to offer so I am shocked by the positive attention and time on the best sellers list this book has generated.  Without giving any spoilers away let me say the book is very cliched and predictable and the leading human characters are all undeveloped and quite stereotyped.  The animals are perhaps given a little more rounded personalities.  The circus portion of the story ends in a fantastic and unbelievable manner and the other story in which our hero is now an old man in a nursing home ends in just as unlikely manner.  Others have commented on the great cover and I wonder if that is responsible for the surprising success of this book.  THE CIRCUS IN WINTER by Cathy Day which came out a couple of years ago is a much better written book and is just as well researched with a very similar setting.
Water for Elephants... what can I say?  The characters were all a bit sad and depressing.  The story was not at all uplifting and left me feeling a little down.  What is good is that you get a great insight into the travelling circus, training around spending one night in each location.  Poor workers had such a hard time of it.  Worth reading but don't expect a happy little love story with this one.  Oh and I thought the ending was quite unbelieveable.
I really wanted to like this book, I really enjoyed learning some of the slang and history of the circus.  I like the circus and I was told I'd fall in love with the animals and the characters of this book.  The fact is I hated the raunchy descriptions surely we could do without those.  I felt the book to be dark, twisted and weird.  I did indeed love the animals but didn't like the characters.  Honestly - I only read half the book because of these things.  Too bad.
This was an easy read but too much sex and a depressing theme.  It did have a surprise ending.  I will compare it to the movie
I felt that some mention should have been made of the large amount of sex and violence this book contained. The story line was interesting, and I enjoyed the surprise ending.  In a good book, with a lot going for it, I don't see the need for graphic sex and violence.  Maybe that's what sells, and picks up movie contracts.
Liked the two time frames but it was a little confusing at times.  Overall it was a good book with timeless themes.
The book gives a different picture of what goes on behind the performance.  Some parts are very hard to shallow and hope they weren't remotely accurate.
I liked the book by all means and it is a good quick read. I guess it didn't grab me like it did others though. The circus theme was a bonus and very different.
Presented through a series of flashbacks by a cantankerous nursing home patient, the story begins as Jacob Jankowski is confronted with the death of his parents.  Hastily, he drops out of school and flees to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  After a fair amount of drama, Jacob is offered a position as vet with the traveling circus.  What follows is, well... a circus - especially when Rosie shuffles into town...Honestly, we could go either way on this novel.  For some reason we are drawn to the enchantment of the circus, so the setting was interesting enough to keep our attention.  We thought the novel captured the spirit of the traveling circus and pulled the curtain on some of the more sleazy aspects of the business.  The treatment of the animals was at times appalling as was the practice of chucking circus workers from moving trains.In many ways, the characters were almost as entertaining as the circus.  Jacob was complex and real.  The lovely Marlena was just as intriguing and provocative in real life as she was in her animal act.  The head animal trainer was pretty much a complete jerk-bag throughout.  Rosie the Elephant was incredibly enduring and a formidable animal character.  And the bearded lady... yeesh.So why didn't we love this book? We're not sure.  It just felt like something was missing.  Maybe there was too much bitterness and anger in the narrator or maybe the relationship between Jacob and Marlena could have been developed more or maybe a high flying monkey act should have been incorporated into the performance.  Whatever the case Water for Elephants was a good book, but not great, and definitely not in our top 10 for 2011.  Finally, with Christmas right around the corner, can we please have a ginormous protective and lovable elephant for Christmas?  You can keep the hippopotamus!
Predictable read. Better that nothing, but would not recommend to anyone who seeks adventure in a book. Rather boring. Sorry
This book is well written, well researched, and overall an interesting story. That said, without a doubt I would have closed it and never finished it due to the abuse of the animals, but I read until the end it because it was a book club choice. This is not a book for animal lovers and I found it to be incredibly painful. Those who torture animals are the scum of the earth in my opinion and I don't enjoy reading about them. Nothing personal Sara Gruen, you are a good writer.
I really wanted to like this book.And I did enjoy the circus parts.But part of the book was told from the perspective of the main character as a nursing home patient. That part was a real downer.It gave me the same feeling as reading \Julie and Julia\.
As a retired circus performer and amateur circus historian, I read Water for Elephants with some hesitancy.  Most circus fiction is hardly worth reading, written by people who have no background in the business.  There was much play about Gruen's doing historical research for her novel at the Circus World Museum in Baraboo.  And there is a lot of interesting history in it.  But there is also some absolutely incredibly unbelieveable stuff, too.  Here are some glaring examples of what I consider to be the \goofiness\ of the novel.Benzini Bros is portrayed as a 50 car railroad circus.  If you know anything about the railroad shows of the era depicted in the book this would have been second in size only to Ringling Bros.and Barnum&Bailey; Circus.  Most circuses of that time, even the smallest shows that traveled by trucks rather than by rail, had at least one elephant -- at least one!  But here is this 50 car railroad show without any!  And during the Great Depression elephants were not that hard to come by as times were tough and shows folded (went broke) and had equipment and animals, including elephants, for sale -- either by choice or by the Sheriff's gavel at forced auctions.  Just amazing that Uncle Al the owner had been unable to get an elephant until Rosy came along.Then Uncle Al  decides to blow his bookings and take his whole darn show out to where he eventually buys his elephant!!!  If there is any rule you don't break with a circus it is that you do not walk away (blow) your bookings, your route!!  If you had a circus the size of this one in the novel your daily nut (expenses) would be very great.  You cannot afford to blow your booked dates unless there was something very major like a foot and mouth disease outbreak that could cause the show to be quarantined for months.  Or the weather in the area you have been book is so bad, you cannot show because of flooding, heavy rains, snow, etc. Or you were following some other shows who have played the area and business is therefore bad.  But you just don't pack up your who show, blow booked dates, and head on out to get some new attraction!!  The way it worked (and still works) was that word of a show folding would be advertised in The Billboard, the show trade publication of the time, and buyers like Uncle Al or his agent would come out to where the defunct show's assets were going to be sold or auctioned off and then the bidding or buying would take place.  If you got your elephant, it was trucked back or loaded on to a railroad freight car and sent to wherever your show was.  But you didn't take your whole show and ship it out to pick up an elephant -- it's a wonder Uncle Al succeeded in building a 50 car show at all with this kind of management!Also I find it kind of strange that Uncle Al's show pulls up along side another, defunct show, and loads that equipment with his and Benzini Bros goes on its merry way.  And then at the end, Benzini Bros becomes the defunct show and another comes along side and loads the remains of Benzini Bros.  If you didn't know better you would think this is way shows would go out of business or be taken over by other shows.  I won't say this kind of thing didn't happen, but TWICE in the story?  Again, when a show folded, it was advertised in The Billboard as well as newpapers in the area it went defunct, and the buyers would come to buy the equipment, wagons, tents and exotic animals, etc.  Horses were not too difficult to sell as horse power was still a major factor on farms at that time.  There were dealers in used show equipment, William P. \Diamond Bill\ Hall of Lancaster, Missouri being one, who bought defunct shows' equipment and animals, and then turn around and sell that stuff to other showmen who would put out a new show with it.I wouldn't have bothered to write this but for the fact that reviews I read of Water for Elephants made a big to do about its historical research and so-called accurate portayal of the depression era railroad circus.  But it is a good read if you discount all the goofiness in it.  Just remember it is fiction and the writer has taken some real liberties with her work.
I listened to the unabridged audio CD version as I drove the last couple of weeks. I know that the book was (and is) a wildly popular bestseller, but I have to confess that the thought that kept nagging at me as I listened was why? I'm not saying this is a bad book. It is somewhat engaging. However, I didn't find any of the characters particularly vivid or humanly multi-dimensional. And as soon as Rosie the elephant was added to the circus, halfway through the book, I had a (correct) feeling as to where the plot line was moving, so no surprise ending. I have no idea whether circus life in the prohibition era was anything like this, so can't comment on the authenticity of the backdrop, but I found it pretty depressing. Altogether, a pretty so-so read.
The writing in this book is about boring and uncreative as it can get. I am not speaking about the story, which is OK, though nothing too special. But the writing style itself and the use of the English language by the author is about as dry and unimaginative as one can get.It's a fast read, and I kept waiting for the plot twist that would make the book a worthwhile read, but was left disappointed. Not a great read, but not horrible either, just very middle of the road and very forgettable. The author used to be a technical writer prior to writing this book and it shows.
Rooting for the underdog is easy to do today, especially when that underdog has been dealt crap in his supposed hand of cards that he brings to the poker game. So, when Sara Gruen attempts to bring us scenes from behind the scene of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth through the creaks and crevices of Jacob Jankowski's memory, does she succeed in doing so? Are you ready for a circus stunt such as this? Well then, read on! ON TO THE BIG TOP MEAT AND POTATOES OF THIS EXTRAVAGANZA AS I DARINGLY ATTEMPT TO WRITE SUCH A REVIEW!!!Just so you know, I didn't think it was the latest and greatest masterpiece that everybody else did, but I didn't think it totally sucked either. Ok, you've been fairly warned, lest I rain on your precious parade, or enlighten it, whatever the case may be for the reader.To get things started, Jacob Jankowski is ninety. Hmmm...or maybe he's ninety three. Ok, ok, he's one or the other, OK?!!? But he's got a story to tell ya, and it ain't about Ringling. It is about one man who's left with nothing after his parents are killed, and he skips out on his vet finals. And that man hops a train, and walks into a hair-raising tale that only Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth can produce in a lifetime! And once he hops this train, he's nothing, but that changes rather quickly when certain authorities learn about his experience with animals, despite not taking his final exams.From there, Jacob is treated to a world of everybody and nobodies, and sometimes the big boys who might be jealous of their wives who married the wrong man. People are supposed to water at the mouth at the tasty treats a circus can only offer, and the men are more than likely to salivate at the \cooch tent,\ where flesh runs rampant for a certain price. He is shown how cruel a man can be, and learns that to get what he wants out of this Main Attraction, he has to fight, and fight dirty, just like the low-lifes who run this show. And of course, there is Rosie, the lone elephant in this show, who isn't always understood, except by Jacob and his hopeful honey, Marlena. The question is, is there any easy way out of this?Unfortunately, Sara Gruen makes it a little too easy in the end, and what seems to be complex, turns just a little too easy for my taste. And in the very end, the ending is not only perfect, but Hollywood couldn't have conjured it up any better than Gruen did. I'm not sure I appreciate such an effort. I respect it, yes. The writing is spectacular. I just wish there was more to it.
I give this book a 2.6.  All those people Jacob's father helped in that little town and no one came forward in his time of tragedy?  It just didn't seem realistic to me.  Someone from immigrant stock with the pluck and drive to get into Cornell vet school is not likely to founder in this situation, nor just dismissively to walk away from his final exams.  Jacob wasn't a pampered trust fund baby; he'd probaby had it a bit rough all along. The rest of the story is just a contrivance built upon an unbelievable premise.
Depressing.  Well written with so much detail I felt I was there at the circus.  Unfortunately, that's the problem.  It's set in the Depression.  The horrible way the animals and workers were treated was too much for me to really enjoy the book.  Very well written though, and I would read other books by this author.
